      <p class="mission">The <b>mission</b> of the <a href="/auto/wg/">Automotive Working Group</a> is
        to develop Open Web Platform specifications for 
        application developers, including but not limited to HTML5/JavaScript, enabling Web connectivity through in-vehicle
        infotainment systems and vehicle data access protocols. The
      API is agnostic with regard to the connection used.</p>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p> This group will develop service specification protocols and APIs to expose vehicle data and information
          from an automotive network bus(es) (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOST_Bus">MOST
            (Media Oriented Systems Transport)</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus">CAN
            (Controller Area Network))</a> to a Web application. The APIs will
          expose information such as the vehicle brand, model, year, fuel type,
          transmission type, steering wheel position, tire pressure, oil level,
          wiper position, lights, doors, windows and seat settings as well as
          navigation, trip computer data, climate control data, speed, RPMs,
          acceleration, gears and other vehicle sensor data.</p>
          <p>In order to enable multiple clients and flexible usage, the prime specification 
          for data access will be a service specification, specifying the mechanisms and protocols
          for accessing vehicle information.  The mechanisms will be firstly based on WebSockets and it could be extended to apply advanced protocols in the future.  In addition, a higher level API which is intended to use the service will be specified
          for facility to web developers.  Initially these specifications will be limited to passenger
          vehicles. How an implementation obtains this data is not in the scope
          of the group.</p>
        <p>The specification(s) produced by this Working Group will include
          security and privacy considerations.</p>
        <p>Members of the Working Group should review other working groups'
          deliverables that are identified as being relevant to the Working
          Group's mission. </p>

        <div id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
        <p> This Working Group will not define or mandate implementation details
          including vehicle, network or sensor protocols for sharing data
          between the vehicle data network and sensors. The vehicle data bus
          network and protocols are OEM specific and vary from vehicle to
          vehicle.</p>
        <p>However, to facilitate interoperability among vehicle OEMs and
          encourage adoption of the specifications, the group may informatively reference
          existing suites of protocols, either directly in the 
          deliverable(s) or in a non-normative companion Note.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have at least two independent implementations of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

            Normative Specifications

          <p>
            The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:

          <dl>
          <dt id="service-spec" class="spec">Vehicle Signal Server Specification</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The Vehicle Signal Server Specification defines the semantics of exposing vehicle information through the WebSocket protocol. This specification is dependent upon the Vehicle Signal Specification, as defined by GENIVI.</p>

          </dl>
          <dt id="vehicle-api" class="spec">Vehicle Signal Client Specification</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The Vehicle Signal Client Specification specifies a JavaScript API for 
            accessing vehicle data.  It is intended to get its data from the Vehicle Signal Server Specification.  
            However, it is also intended to provide a level of
            abstraction from the service.</p>

            Other non-normative documents may be created such as:
          </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Use cases and requirements </dt>
          <dd>The Working Group is strongly encouraging the participants to
            create and maintain a use cases and requirements document for each
            specification.</dd>
          <dt>Implementation guidelines </dt>
          <dd>To facilitate interoperability among different vehicle OEMs and
            encourage adoption of the API, the group may provide informative
            guidelines for implementors as a separate group Note.
            This note will includes security and privacy recommendation for
            the environment surrounding API implementation. </dd>
          <dt>Test suite </dt>
          <dd> A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is
            necessary to ensure the specification's robustness, consistency, and
            implementability, and to promote interoperability between clients.
	    Therefore, each specification must have a companion test
            suite, which should be completed before transition to Candidate
            Recommendation, and which must be completed with an implementation
            report before transition to Proposed Recommendation. Additional
            tests may be added to the test suite at any stage of the
            Recommendation track, and the maintenance of a implementation report
            is encouraged. </dd>
        </dl>
        Other non-normative documents may be created for each specification, for

        <p>
          To be successful, this (Working|Interest) Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the (Working|Interest) Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the (Working|Interest) Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
