    <!-- Abstract -->
    <section id="abstract">
	<p>This specification defines a WebSocket based API for a vehicle information service that provides the functionality for client applications to get, set, subscribe and unsubscribe to vehicle signals and data attributes.</p>
	<p>The purpose of the specification is to promote a Server API that enables application development in a consistent manner across participating automotive manufacturers.</p>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The vehicle SHALL expose vehicle signals and static data via a WebSocket. This
      enables a client to GET or SET vehicle signals and data; to SUBSCRIBE to receive
      notifications and to UNSUBSCRIBE from receiving notifications.</p>

      <p>The API that is used to manage access to vehicle signals and static data is defined in this Vehicle Information Service
	 Specification (VISS). The VISS also describes a discovery mechanism that defines the set of signals and data that a client can access at a
         particular point in time.</p>

      <p>The term 'signal' is used here to represent an item of	data that can vary over time, for example vehicle speed,
	 whilst the expression 'static data' is used to denote a temporally invariant property like vehicle width.</p>

      <p>The GENIVI Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) defines the set of vehicle signals and data that are exposed via this Vehicle
        Information Service Specification (VISS). The Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) supports both extensibility and the ability
	to define private branches.</p>

      <p>In addition, the 'tree' of signals that is accessible at any point in time may also vary depending on standard access control principles.
         That is, it can vary based on the identity of the user (person or organisation) requesting the data and/or the application or
	 device (e.g. vehicle) where the request originates.</p>

      <p>To support this, the Service Specification describes an extensible token based security mechanism that can optionally be used to pass tokens to the WebSocket Server,
        for example to represent the user of an application and/or the device that the client application is running on.</p>

      <p>A future revision of this specification may consider additionally exposing vehicle signals
      via a RESTful web service but this is out of scope for this version of the specification.</p>

      <p>A component or module running on the vehicle SHALL create a WebSocket instance which will listen for an inbound
      connection request from a client to enable secure access to vehicle signals. In this specification this module is referred
      to as the 'WebSocket Vehicle Information Service' (WVIS) or for simplicity as 'the server'.</p>

      <p>This specification assumes that a single WebSocket is used to enable communication between a client application
      and the server. It is not explicitly prohibited for the client to request that the server opens more than one WebSocket,
      however, the server may refuse to open a subsequent WebSocket connection and the client is responsible for handling this
      gracefully.</p>

      <p>If more than one WebSocket connection is established between a client application and the server then each connection
      MUST be managed independently. For example, subscriptions created using a particular WebSocket connection SHALL only trigger
      notifications via that connection and the client MUST use that WebSocket connection to unsubscribe. </p>

      <p>If more than one WebSocket connection has been established
      between one or more clients and a particular server instance, there
      is a risk that race conditions and concurrency issues could occur.
      An example of this would be where two or more WebSocket connections
      are used to update a particular setting at the same time.</p>

      <p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the client can only assume
      that the server implements a simple concurrency model where lost
      updates and dirty reads could potentially occur if the server has
      more than one WebSocket connection open.</p>

      <p>It is recommended that this Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS) is read in conjunction with the W3C Vehicle
      Information API Specification (VIAS). The Vehicle Information API Specification defines a client API that wraps the data access
      and security primitives defined in this Service Specification. It has been defined to support the development of
      'standards-compliant' JavaScript libraries that can be used by web based clients.</p>
      <p>The Vehice Information Service API MAY be invoked directly, the following example illustrates how a client could invoke the VISS API.
      This simplified example is for illustrative purposes only, it does not show error handling and is not
	intended to be commercial code.</p>

 <pre class="example highlight">
// Open the WebSocket
var vehicle  = new WebSocket("wss://wwwivi", "wvss1.0");

// Establish authorization
vehicle.onopen = function () {
  vehicle.send('{"action": "authorize", "tokens": {"authorization": "user_token_value"}, "requestId": "103"}');
};

// Message response handler for all possible actions
vehicle.onmessage = function(event){
  var msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
  switch(msg.action){
    case "authorize":
      authHandler(msg);
      break;
    case "getVSS":
      getVSSHandler(msg);
      break;
    case "get":
      getReqHandler(msg);
      break;
    case "set":
      setReqHandler(msg);
      break;
    case "subscribe":
      subscriptionSetupHandler(msg);
      break;
    case "subscription":
      subscriptionHandler(msg);
      break;
    case "unsubscribe":
      unsubscribeHandler(msg, false);
      break;
    case "unsubscribeAll":
      unsubscribeHandler(msg, true);
      break;
  }
};

// Auth request handler
function authHandler(msg) {
  if(msg.hasOwnProperty("TTL")){
    console.log("Authorisation successful");
    requestVSS();
  } else {
    console.log("Authorisation unsuccessful");
  }
}

// Close the WebSocket to end the WebSocket session
function closeSocket(){
  vehicle.close();
}
  </pre>
  <p>Once the WebSocket connection has been established, the client is able to retrieve the VSS from the server and request signals for the clients current level of authentication.</p>
  <pre class="example highlight">
// Request the entire VSS tree
function requestVSS(){
  vehicle.send('{"action": "getVSS", "requestId": "103"}');
}

// Request the entire VSS tree and if successful, request a signal
function getVSSHandler(msg){
  if(msg.hasOwnProperty('vss')){
    console.log("VSS Received");
    console.log("VSS: " + JSON.stringify(msg.vss));
    getSignal(vss, "Signal.Drivetrain.Transmission.Speed");
  } else {
    console.log("getVSS Error");
  }
}

// Request a signal
function getSignal(vss, path){
  // A check could be made here to ensure the signal is available in the VSS
  vehicle.send('{"action": "get", "path": ' + path + ', "requestId": "105"}');
}
  </pre>

  <p>The client is also able to subscribe to signals if the client's authentication permits access.</p>

  <pre class="example highlight">
// Set a subscription, assuming the same authorization and set up from Example 1
var rpmSubscriptionId, rpmRequestId = "106";

// Set up the subscription
function subscribeToRPMNotifications(){
  vehicle.send('{"action": "subscribe", "path": "Signal.Drivetrain.InternalCombustionEngine.RPM",  "requestId": ' + rpmRequestId + '}');
}

// Handle the subscription response
function subscriptionSetupHandler(msg){
    if(msg.hasOwnProperty("requestId") && msg.requestId == rpmRequestId){
      console.log("Subscription set with a subscription ID of " + msg.subscriptionId);
      rpmSubscriptionId = msg.subscriptionId;
    }
}

// Handle the subscription notification
function subscriptionHandler(msg){
    if(msg.hasOwnProperty("subscriptionId") && msg.subscriptionId == rpmSubscriptionId){
      console.log("The current engine rpm is " + msg.value);
    }
}

  </pre>
        <p>The target platform supported by the specification is exclusively passenger vehicles. Use of this
	specification for non-passenger applications (for example heavy machinery, marine and airline infotainment) is
	not prohibited, but is not covered in the design or content of the API.</p>

	<p>An example use case could be the implementation of a 'Home Mechanic' application that provides warnings if any
	the following need attention: tire pressure, engine oil level, washer fluid level and battery charge level.</p>

	<p>Exposing vehicle signals in a standardized manner facilitates the integration of vehicles within the Web of Things (WoT)
	and supports future use case innovations in a variety of fields including transportation, safety, navigation, energy management,
	smart transportation and consumer infotainment.</p>

	<p>The data format used for client/server communication within this specification is JSON encoded strings, however other data formats may be supported in future versions of the specification.</p>

      <!-- Architecture -->
      <section id="architecture" class="informative">
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>In a typical vehicle design, signals and data are transmitted between Electronic Control Units (ECUs) connected
      via internal vehicle networks. These include Controller Area Networks (CAN), Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST)
      and Local Interconnect Networks (LIN). ECUs on these networks broadcast messages on network buses, and other ECUs on the
      bus respond to the messages.</p>

      <p>In the component diagram included below, the internal vehicle CAN, MOST and LIN networks and the ECUs that communicate
      via these networks are abstracted and for simplicity, represented by the <dfn>System</dfn> component.</p>

      <p>For safety, security and commercial reasons not all clients should be able to GET, SET or SUBSCRIBE to particular vehicle
      signals and data attributes. As a consequence, access-control must be managed so clients cannot simply connect directly to ECUs
      or to CAN, MOST or LIN network buses.</p>

      <p>In this specification, the term 'signal' refers to a value that can change over time, for example, vehicle speed,
      whilst 'static data' or simply 'data' is used for a value that does not change e.g. vehicle length.</p>

      <p>The vehicle signals and static data that are available within the vehicle System are exposed in a controlled
      manner to the Web Socket Server. The interface and communication mechanisms that are used between the vehicle System and
      the Web Socket Server are outside of the scope of this specification.</p>

      </figure>

      <h3>WebSocket Server</h3>
      <p>The <dfn>WebSocket Server</dfn> is the vehicle system that is responsible for exposing vehicle signals and data to
      its clients by implementing the interface and behaviours defined in this <dfn>Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS)</dfn>.</p>

      <p>The WebSocket Server exposes signals and data in a manner that is consistent with the <dfn>Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS)</dfn>.
      This defines a 'tree-like' logical taxonomy of the vehicle, (formally a Directed Acyclic Graph), where major vehicle structures
      (e.g. body, engine) are near the top of the tree and the logical assemblies and components that comprise them, are defined as
      their child nodes. Each of the child nodes in the tree is further decomposed into its logical constituents, and the process is
      repeated until <dfn>leaf nodes</dfn> are reached. A 'leaf node' is a node at the end of a branch that cannot be decomposed
      because it represents a single signal or data attribute value. An example VSS tree is shown below, its contents are illustrative:</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/VSS_Tree_Simple_Example_v1.png" alt="Diagram showing an example Vehicle Signal tree">
        <figcaption>Diagram showing an example Vehicle Signal Tree</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Signals are named according to their path using the dot notation e.g. engine.rpm.</p>

      <p>The client MAY invoke the WebSocket Server <a>getVSS</a> method to request that the server returns metadata that
      describes which signals and data attributes could potentially be accessed provided that the user and/or device is suitably
      authorised. This and other valid WebSocket Server actions are defined in more detail <a href="#action">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>In-Vehicle Clients</h3>
      <p>In-vehicle clients include both those clients that are running on an ECU in the vehicle itself,
      e.g. an ECU that implements an In Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system, but also includes clients running on a user's
      device, e.g. a laptop, phone or tablet, that is connected via the vehicle's WiFi client (if one exists).</p>

      <p>The methods defined on the WebSocket Server interface may be invoked by different types of on-board and off-board clients.
      On-board clients, running on the vehicle fall into one of two major categories:</p>

      <p><dfn>Applications</dfn> can access vehicle signals and data and have a User Interface that the driver or passengers in the
      vehicle can interact with.</p>

      <p><dfn>Agents</dfn> typically have no user interface. They can also invoke methods exposed on the WebSocket Server but their
      purpose is to connect to one or more off-board e.g. <dfn>Vehicle to Everything (V2X)</dfn> internet Servers in order to send
      data off-board.</p>

      <p>Both applications and agents can be subdivided into those that are web-based and which run in a 'Web Runtime' and are
      implemented using Web Standards like HTML, CSS and JavaScript; those that run in their own native process written using
      e.g. C, C++ or Objective-C; and those that run in a Managed Runtime process written using languages like C#
      or Java.</p>

      <p>Web applications and web agents MAY directly invoke the Vehicle Information Service interface exposed by the WebSocker server,
      but it is expected that they typically access vehicle signals and data via a JavaScript Library that implements the
      W3C Vehicle Information API Specification (VIAS) (TODO Add Link when document exists). The VIAS is a client API that defines a
      standard approach to encapsulate or 'wrap' the API defined in this specification to make it easier for Web based clients to
      access vehicle signals and data in a controlled way.</p>

      <h3>Sending Signals and Data off-board</h3>
      <p>In addition to local, in-vehicle applications and agents, a variety of internet-based clients and servers may be interested
      in accessing vehicle signals and data. However, when a vehicle is not being used, most electrical systems are shut down in
      order to maximise battery life. This may include the systems that enable Wireless or Mobile connectivity. Then, when the vehicle
      is powered up, various systems start up, including those that provide off-board connectivity and the vehicle typically
      connects either to a local WiFi network or to a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) and is dynamically assigned an IP address.</p>

      <p>At this point, internet based clients and servers do not know the dynamic IP address that was assigned to a specific vehicle.
      So normally, a vehicle has to connect to a well known endpoint, generally using a URL to connect to a V2X Server.
      The vehicle and the internet server typically mutually authenticate and the vehicle 'registers' with the server over
      an encrypted channel passing it a unique identifier e.g. its Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). From that point on, the server
      has the IP address that is currently assigned to a vehicle with a particular VIN, and can share this information with other
      internet based clients and servers, which are then able to send messages to the vehicle.</p>

      <p>However, if the vehicle loses connectivity and is dynamically assigned a new IP address, it needs to re-register its new
      IP address and the new address needs to be communicated to any interested parties. For simplicity, this is not shown in the
      component diagram, primarily because this connectivity only becomes possible after the vehicle has registered with at least one
      off-board server (which is shown) but also because these scenarios do not affect the interface and behaviours defined in this
      WebSocket Service Specification</p>

      <p>The component diagram shows four different types of internet based clients. A user may use a <dfn>Web Page</dfn> or a <dfn>
      Web Application</dfn> running on a phone or tablet to request access to vehicle signals on a particular vehicle. Alternatively
      these signals could be accessed using a <dfn>Native or Managed Runtime Application</dfn> or via another automated
      <dfn>Client System</dfn> or service e.g. the Traffic Management System in a 'Smart City'.</p>

      <!-- Security and privacy -->
      <section id="security">
        <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The server implementation MAY optionally restrict access to one or more vehicle signals so that they can only
	be accessed in response to a request from an authorized user and/or device. This could be for a variety of
	reasons, including safety, privacy or commercial considerations.</p>

	<p>Hence, a request to GET, SET, SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE to data may require the client to demonstrate
	to the server that the request is from one or more suitably authorized Security Principals.</p>

        <p>The different types of Security Principal, the approach taken to control access to signals and the importance of data privacy are described in the sections that follow.</p>

        <h3>Security Principals</h3>
	<p>The types of security principal include:</p>

        <table class="parameters">
	  <tr>
	    <th>Type</th>
	    <th>Description</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>User</td>
	    <td>A person, system or organisation responsible for making the request e.g. driver, Emergency Services,
	        Smart City Traffic Management System.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Device</td>
	    <td>Vehicle or device where the request originates. Could for example be a user's Consumer Electronics
		(CE) device connected to the vehicle's WiFi hotspot or another vehicle in a convoy;  an Electronic Control
		Unit (ECU) on the same vehicle or any internet connected system e.g. a Web of Things (WoT) device.</td>
	  </tr>
        </table>

	<h3>Access Control and Authorization</h3>
        <p>When a client makes a request to access signal data it is performing the request on behalf of one or more
        Security Principals, that is, for a particular user and/or vehicle/device.</p>

        <p>Access to signals is managed and controlled by the server. The server MAY elect not to enforce access
        controls on a particular signal or set of signals and to enforce different access controls on other signals.</p>

        <p>For each security principal that must be authorised by the server, the client SHALL obtain and pass a security token
        e.g. an OAuth 2.0 token (see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC6749</a>) to the server using a message
        containing an 'authorize' action as defined <a href="#authorize">here</a>.</p>

        <p>A server implementation MAY require that a request for a particular signal includes a security token for
        both the user (e.g. driver of the vehicle) and for the device (e.g. the vehicle) that is hosting the client.
        A request for a different set of vehicle signals MAY require that only the user is authorized or that only the device
        is authorized to access particular signals.</p>

        <h3>WebSocket Channel Authorization</h3>
        <p>The client MAY send a message with an 'authorize' action to modify the access-control state of the WebSocket channel.
        The message structure is defined in detail <a href="#message-structure">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The following diagram illustrates a scenario where the client requests vehicle speed. In this example scenario, this
        signal is not under access control and so the server returns a message containing the requested data. The client then
        requests that the server sets the vehicle trunk status to open and the server demands that the client passes access-control
        credentials before satisfying the request. The steps are shown in more detail in the diagram below:</p>

          <figcaption>Diagram showing conceptual WebSocket Security Token flow (data structures are illustrative only)</figcaption>
        </figure>

	      <p class="note">TODO: Update diagram to reflect auth token structure and review including other diagrams from Wiki</p>
        <p>After receiving a message with an 'authorize' action the server attempts to verify the tokens e.g. by checking
        with the issuing Security Authority. If all of the tokens that are passed to the server are valid, it returns
        a success response and all subsequent requests received by the WebSocket instance have elevated access control
        privileges. Specifically, each of the GET, SET, SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE actions have the access control rights
        that the server deems to be appropriate for the security principals represented by the token(s).</p>

        <p>If the client sends a subsequent 'authorize' message to the server with different token value(s). If one or more of these
        are invalid, then the server returns an error response and the WebSocket access control status remain unchanged.
        However, if the new token values are valid, then the server returns a success response and the access control
        privileges associated with the new token(s) only, applies for all requests from that point.</p>

        <p>If the client or the server close the WebSocket connection and a new WebSocket instance is opened, then it is
        opened without elevated access control privileges.

        <p>This service specification defines a standardized, token based approach for access control that includes specific error
        responses for common user and device access control scenarios. It is important however, that the security model is extensible.
        Hence, the server MAY implement any type of token that is  consistent with this standardized approach and MAY optionally
        define additional token(s) for other Security Principal type(s). If this is the case, it is expected that the precise type of security tokens that are supported by a particular server
        implementation, the format of those tokens and all additional error codes and reasons (e.g. to indicate that an
        additional token type has expired and needs to be renewed) is defined in the Server's documentation.</p>

        <h3>Use of Encryption</h3>
        <p>To support a layered security model and to help establish a 'defence in depth', all vehicle signal and data communications
        between the client and server MUST be strongly encrypted. This is to make it more difficult for an attacker to eavesdrop or
        tamper with the security tokens; the request data or the response payload.</p>

        <p>One way in which this may be implemented is for the client and the server to use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
        approach, where the client verifies the server's identity by checking the server's X.509 certificate and the client and
        the server negotiate to establish a secure Transport Layer Security (TLS) 'tunnel'.</p>

        <p>The WebSocket protocol mandates that if a client requests that the server opens a WebSocket connection and the request
        is received over HTTPS, then the WebSocket is established over TLS, that is, a secure 'wss' connection is created.</p>

        <h3>Token Renewal</h3>
        <p>Each security token SHALL have a specified lifetime during which it is valid. If on receiving a request for signals that are
        subject to access-control, the server determines that the request is unauthorised because the token has expired, the server
        returns an error response indicating the fact and the client requests a new token from the Security Authority and
        repeat the request.</p>

        <p>If the server returns an error response indicating that the request is forbidden, renewing the security token does
        not make the request valid. In this case, the client should not repeat the request unless some other change has been made
        that may mean the request is now valid.</p>

      <!-- Initialisation of the Web Socket -->
      <section>
	<h3>Initialisation of the Web Socket</h3>

	<p>If the client application is an HTML Application running in a web
	runtime or is a web page running in a browser, the WebSocket
	instance may either be instantiated natively or be created using a
	'standards compliant' WebSocket JavaScript library.</p>
	<p>A WebSocket can also be initiated from a native (e.g. C++) Application
	or from an Application written using a 'Managed Runtime' language like
	Java or C#. It is assumed that native and managed clients use a
	suitable standards compliant WebSocket library to request that a
	WebSocket connection is opened on the server.</p>

	<p>A client running on the vehicle is able to connect to the
	WebSocket Server instance using the hostname 'wwwivi' and uses the
	default port 443. The hostname 'wwwivi' may locally be mapped to the localhost
	IP address 127.0.0.1 e.g. by adding an entry to the /etc/hosts file.</p>

	<p>The sub-protocol name SHALL be 'wvss' with a version number suffix, e.g. wvss1.0</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> vehicle  = new WebSocket("wss://wwwivi", "wvss1.0");
	</pre>

	<p class="note">Discuss merits of using 'wwwivi' as a standardised hostname. Do we want a more generic
		hostname, not just for IVI but also encompassing WoT standards?</p>

	<p>The client SHALL connect to the server over HTTPS and request that
	the server opens a WebSocket. All WebSocket communications between
	the client and server MUST be over ‘wss’. Non encrypted communication
	is not supported, hence the server MUST refuse ‘ws’ connection requests.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Message Structure -->
      <section>
      <h3>Message Structure</h3>

       <p>The client MUST use the WebSocket <dfn>send</dfn> method, defined
       <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-websockets-20110929/#the-websocket-interface">here</a>,
        to pass request messages to the server. The message signature SHALL be:</p>

	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
		WebSocket.send(request)
	</pre>
	<p>The request message MUST be comprised of one the request objects defined in this section. The client SHALL
	receive responses from the server using the WebSocket <dfn>onmessage</dfn> method, as follows:</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
		WebSocket.onmessage = function(obj){
			// process data
		}
	</pre>
	<p>The message returned by the server MUST be one of the response objects defined in the table below.</p>

		}
	</pre>

    <p>This specification purposely does not define the token structure and the methods to secure tokens. Providers of the server may choose their own preferred formats and security methods. The server may also treat tokens as opaque structures and pass them on to underlying software layers for evaluation.</p>

    <p>While this specification does not mandate the token format and structure it SHALL at least contain the following elements to provide meaningful authorization:</p>

    <table class="parameters">
      <tr>
        <th>Element</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Path</td>
        <td>The signal path (defined <a href="#dfn-path">here</a>) the token authorizes. The path may be a branch name or contain wildcards to authorize entire branches.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> <dfn>Actions</dfn></td>
        <td>List of actions that the token authorizes for the path. The list contains at least one of the actions <a>getVSS</a>, <a>get</a>, <a>set</a>, <a>subscribe</a>, <a>subscription</a> and <a>unsubscribe</a>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> <dfn>Valid From</dfn></td>
        <td>Timestamp in UTC indicating the date and time from which on the token is valid.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> <dfn>Valid Until</dfn></td>
        <td>Tmestamp in UTC indicating the date and time until which the token is valid.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    	<p>It is expected that client and server use the same token format. If a client presents a token using a
	    format that is not understood by the server, the server rejects the token.</p>

	<p>In order to make dictionary attacks more difficult, authentication will be denied after a number of failed authentication
		requests. A 401 (Unauthorised) too_many_requests error will be sent by the server in response
		to any subsequent authentication requests. The number of failed requests and the period
		of time during which attempts will be denied is to be determined by the implementation.</p>

	<h2>VSS Request</h2>
	<p>The client MAY use the 'getVSS' action to request metadata describing the potentially available VSS tree. It does
	this by sending a 'vssRequest' message to the server. If the server is able to return the VSS metadata, then this
	is returned using a 'vssSuccessResponse' message. If an error occurs, the server returns a 'vssErrorResponse'
	message to the client.</p>

	<p>The client is able to request VSS metadata from any point in the VSS tree, such that only the metadata for the signals
	within the given branch of the tree is returned. For example, only metadata for the chassis branch of the tree is returned
	when the chassis path is specified. If the path is not set, the response contains the metadata for the entire VSS tree.</p>

        <p>If more than one 'getVSS' call is made with the same 'vssRequest' message content but at different times, the metadata
        in the 'vssSuccessResponse' SHALL be the same provided the access-control state of the WebSocket channel has not changed.</p>

      <h4>Examples</h4>
      <p>It is important to note that all examples involving paths are illustrative. Valid path values and the signals and data
      attributes that correspond to a particular path are defined in the Vehicle Signal Specification.</p>

      <p>The example below shows the JSON structure for a 'getRequest' message sent by the client to obtain the engine RPM value
      and a 'getSuccessResponse' returned by the server.</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	client -> {
		"action": "get",
		"path": "Signal.Drivetrain.InternalCombustionEngine.RPM",
		"requestId": "8756"
	}

	receive <- {
		"action": "get",
		"requestId": "8756",
		"value": 2372,
		"timestamp": &lt;DOMTimeStamp&gt;
	}
	</pre>

	<p>In the case where the server returns a value that is a <dfn>complex type</dfn>, i.e. a value that
	is not a single basic JavaScript type (e.g. string, number, boolean), the value SHALL be returned as
	a set of name/value pairs in a JSON object structure. The format MUST be as defined by the Vehicle Signal Specification.<p>

	<p>The following shows an example of a 'getRequest' that results in the server returning a 'getSuccessResponse' with a value
	that is a complex type:</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	client -> {
		"action": "get",
		"path": "Signal.Body.Trunk",
		"requestId": "9078"
	}

	receive <- {
		"action": "get",
		"requestId": "9078",
		"value": { "Signal.Body.Trunk.IsLocked": false,
			"Signal.Body.Trunk.IsOpen": true },
		"timestamp": &lt;DOMTimeStamp&gt;
	}
	</pre>

	<p>One or more wildcards (denoted by asterisk '*') MAY be included at
	any level in the path to specify that all nodes at that level are to be included.</p>

	<p>In the example below, the path in the 'getRequest' includes a wildcard at the levels above
	the leaf (signal) node, in order to request just the 'IsLocked' state for all doors.</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	client -> {
		"action": "get",
		"path": "Signal.Cabin.Door.*.IsLocked",
		"requestId": "4523"
	}

	receive <- {
		"action": "get",
		"requestId": "4523",
		"value": [ {"Signal.Cabin.Door.Row1.Right.IsLocked" : true },
		           {"Signal.Cabin.Door.Row1.Left.IsLocked" : true },
			       {"Signal.Cabin.Door.Row2.Right.IsLocked" : false },
			       {"Signal.Cabin.Door.Row2.Left.IsLocked" : true } ],
		"timestamp": &lt;DOMTimeStamp&gt;
	}
	</pre>

	<p>In this example, a complex type with a nested array is returned in response to the Path: "Signal.Cabin.Door.*"
	which denotes: 'Return all signals and data attributes for all doors'. For simplicity, the example
	assumes that the VSS definition for each door only has two attributes 'IsLocked' and 'Window.Position'.</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	client -> {
		"action": "get",
		"path": "Signal.Cabin.Door.*",
		"requestId": "6745"
	}

	receive <- {
		"action": "get",
		"requestId": "6745",
		"value": [ {"Signal.Cabin.Door.Row1.Right.IsLocked" : true, "Signal.Cabin.Door.Row1.Right.Window.Position": 50},
		           {"Signal.Cabin.Door.Row1.Left.IsLocked" : true, "Signal.Cabin.Door.Row1.Left.Window.Position": 23},
		           {"Signal.Cabin.Door.Row2.Right.IsLocked" : false, "Signal.Cabin.Door.Row2.Right.Window.Position": 100 },
		           {"Signal.Cabin.Door.Row2.Left.IsLocked": true, "Signal.Cabin.Door.Row2.Left.Window.Position": 0 } ],
		"timestamp": &lt;DOMTimeStamp&gt;
	}
	</pre>
	<p>The following shows a request for non-existent data</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	client -> {
		"action": "get",
		"path": "Body.Flux.Capacitor",
		"requestId": "1245"

	<h2>Set</h2>

	<p>The client may request that the server sets the value of a signal e.g. to lock a door or open a window by sending
	a 'setRequest' message to the server. If the server is able to satisfy the request it SHALL return a 'setSuccessResponse'
	message. If an error occurs e.g. because the client is not authorised to set the requested value, or the value is read-only,
	the server SHALL return a 'setErrorResponse' message.<p>

  <h4>Examples</h4>
  <p>For example when client need to continuously receive "Signal.Drivetrain.Transmission.TripMeter" information from the server, it can use "subscribe" action with the target property like below.</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	client -> {
		"action": "subscribe",
		"path": "Signal.Drivetrain.Transmission.TripMeter",
		"requestId": "1004"
	}

	receive <- {
    "action": "subscribe",
		"requestId": "1004",
    "subscriptionId": "35472",
    "timestamp": &lt;DOMTimeStamp&gt;
	}
  </pre>
  When this "subscribe" request has been successed, client will receive a notificaton with changing value continuously as below JSON structure.

  <pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
  receive <- {
    "action": "subscription",
    "subscriptionId": "35472",
    "value": 36912,
    "timestamp": &lt;DOMTimeStamp&gt;
	}
  </pre>

	</pre>
	<p>The client can use the 'requestId' value to associate the successful
	subscription response with the original request.</p>

	<p>The 'subscriptionId' value is a unique value, created by the server and
	which is used internally by the server to manage subscriptions
	on that WebSocket instance.</p>

	<p>The subscription id value may be used by the client to
	unsubscribe from receiving future notifications, by passing the
	handle value to the server with the unsubscribe action.</p>

	<p>To differentiate subscription response from responses for ‘GET’
	requests, subscription responses shall additionally include the
	subscription id value that identifies the subscription that
	triggered that notification.</p>

	<p>The server ensures that a new unique subscription id value is
	returned for each successful subscription request on a particular
	WebSocket connection. However the server does not guarantee that
	subscription handle values are unique between different WebSocket
	instances.</p>

	<p>Once the subscription is successfully registered with the server,
	the client receives subscription notifications containing the requested
	data, at a rate defined either by the server or by the server side filter. If there is an
	error with an existing subscription a subscriptionNotificationError is
	received by the client. This allows the client to handle the error, such as to reduce the subscription
	frequency if the server is unable to satisfy the initial demands of the client.</p>

	<p>If the authentication token expires whilst a subscription is active, the server will send a
	subscriptionNotificationError for each subscription that can no longer be fulfilled. The client is then
	responsible for requesting a renewed authentication token.</p>

	<p>After the client authentication token has expired, the server MAY continue to send notifications for data that
	is not subject to access control restrictions. The client will NOT receive notifications for subscriptions that require
	a valid authentication token until the client sends a renewed authentication token to the server.</p>

	<p> If a new authentication token is presented by the client to the server in a timely manner,	all existing subscriptions
	will continue to cause notifications to be sent from the server, provided the security principal
	has not changed. The time window during which the client MAY re-authenticate and subscriptions continue WILL be
	implementation dependent.</p>

	<p>At any time the server MUST only send subscription notifications for data that the client is authorised to access.</p>

        <p>The server MAY close the WebSocket connection at any time and in so doing, terminate all subscriptions for the client.
	The client is then responsible for renewing subscriptions. The client MUST close the WebSocket connection if the server
	data is no longer required.</p>

  	<p>An example of a subscription can be found <a href="#introduction">here</a>.</p>

	<h2>Unsubscribe</h2>
        <p>To unsubscribe from a subscription, the client SHALL send an 'unsubscribeRequest' message to the server. This is
        comprised of a JSON structure which contains an action property set to 'unsubscribe' and a string containing the
        'subscriptionId'. If the server is able to satisfy the request it returns an 'unsubscribeSuccessResponse'. If an error
	occurs, for example because an invalid subscriptionId is passed to the server, an 'unsubscribeErrorResponse' is returned.</p>

	<p>The client MAY unsubscribe from all of its subscriptions by sending an 'unsubscribeRequest' with the action property set to
	'unsubscribeAll'. This does not require a subscriptionId value. If the request is successful, or there are no active subscriptions
	to unsubscribe from, this will return an 'unsubscribeSuccessResponse'.</p>

	<p>If the client has created more than one WebSocket instance, it MUST always unsubscribe using the same WebSocket instance
	that was originally used to create the subscription.</p>

	<p>It is not possible to unsubscribe from a subset of signals within a subscription. The client must unsubscribe
	and set up a new subscription with the desired signals. For example, if there is an active subscription
	for all lights, using the path Signal.Body.Lights.*, and the client requires information for only Signal.Body.Lights.IsLowBeamOn,
	the client will have to unsubscribe from the Signal.Body.Lights.* subscription and re-subscribe to Signal.Body.Lights.IsLowBeamOn.</p>

	<p>The client should always unsubscribe from receiving notifications when it is no longer using the data. Over a long
	vehicle journey, this significantly reduces the processing load on the server and allow the server to free memory.
	It therefore makes it more likely that the server remains responsive to future requests from the client.</p>

      <h3>Server Side Filtering</h3>
      <p>'<a>Filters</a>' may be specified to enable Server side filtering
      to be used to throttle the demands of subscriptions on
      the server. This may enable the reduction of traffic if the
      developer has received a 429 - Too Many Requests error
      message. Server side filters are extensible, allowing for further filtering mechanisms. Support
      is currently provisioned for a specific range of values, time intervals and
      minimum changes. This can be implemented using the "filters"
      option in the subscribeRequest interface.</p>

	<p>Filters can only be applied for nodes in the VSS tree, not entire branches.
	For example, a filter cannot be set on Signal.Drivetrain.InternalCombustionEngine.*,
	however it can be set on Signal.Drivetrain.InternalCombustionEngine.RPM.</p>

      <p>The default behaviour for a subscription is to send values to the client only onchange.
      To modify this behaviour the client can use filtering options. The following filter options
      SHALL be supported.</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Interval - requests that the server provides a notification every 'n' milliseconds. This allows the client to reduce the
	load on the server if the client does not need the data more frequently.</li>
	<li>Range - provide a value only when within a given range</li>
	<li>Minimum change - provide data when a value has changed by a specified amount</li>
      </ul>
	<p>If the filter is not set, or the server is unable to satisfy the request, the notification frequency is
      determined by the server.</p>

      <h4></h4>
      <h4></h4>
      <h4>JSON Schema</h4>
<pre>
{
  "filters": {
      "$ref": "#/definitions/filters"
  }
}
</pre>

      <h4>Examples</h4>
	<p>The following structures are examples of subscribeRequest objects which are requesting server side filters</p>
      <pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	//client receives data every 100ms
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "&lt;any_path&gt;",
        	"filters": { "interval": 100 },
        	"requestId": "&lt;some_unique_value&gt;" }

	//client receives data when the value is between 100 and 200 (inclusive)
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "&lt;any_path&gt;",
        	"filters": { "range": { "above": 100, "below": 200 } },
        	"requestId": "&lt;some_unique_value&gt;" }

	//client receives data when the value is below 100 (inclusive)
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "&lt;any_path&gt;",
        	"filters": { "range": { "below": 100 } },
        	"requestId": "&lt;some_unique_value&gt;" }

	//client receives data when the value changes by 100 units
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "&lt;any_path&gt;",
        	"filters": { "minChange": 100 },
        	"requestId": "&lt;some_unique_value&gt;" }

	//client receives data when the value is above 200 (inclusive)
	//and the value changes by 20 units
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "&lt;any_path&gt;",
        	"filters": { "range": { "below": 200 }, "minChange": 20},
        	"requestId": "&lt;some_unique_value&gt;" }
      </pre>

      <p>When the range filter is used a final message is sent when the value returned is outside
      of the specified range. For example, if the range states { "below": 100 }, a final value may
      be received at 101 to indicate that the value is now out of range.</p>

      <p>The client should not specify a minimum change amount that is smaller than it needs - in order to prevent
	adding unnecessary load on the server. The server shall return a '429 - Too Many Request' error response if
	it is unable to fulfil the request made by the client.</p>

      <p>The section that follows defines the error responses that shall be supported by the server.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
	<h3>Web Socket Closure</h3>
	<p>The WebSocket may be closed by either the client or the
	server by invoking the ‘close()’ method on the WebSocket
	instance.</p>

	<p>The following example shows the lifetime of a WebSocket on
	the client:</p>
	<pre class="example highlight">
// Open the WebSocket
var vehicle  = new WebSocket("wss://localhost:4343", "wvss1.0");

// WebSocket is used to GET, SET, SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE
…

// Close the WebSocket
vehicle.close();
	</pre>
	<p>The WebSocket server may terminate the WebSocket connection
	if it has not received a request for a period determined by
	the server. It is the client’s responsibility to handle this
	gracefully and to recover and request new
	subscriptions, where required.</p>
      </section>



      <section>
	<h3>Errors</h3>
	<p>If there is an error with any of the client’s requests, the
	server responds with an error number, reason and
	message.</p>

        An error reason is also returned, this contains a pre-defined string value that
        can be used to distinguish between errors that have the same code (e.g. '401 Unauthorized)' but a difference cause.
        The error message is used to provide message text describing the cause in more detail.</p>

        <p>The server may optionally return additional error codes. It is expected that if this is the case, they are defined in the Server Documentation.
        Wherever possible the Server returns a standard HTTP error code where one has been defined for the error condition.
        See for example <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231">RFC7231</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235">RFC7235</a>,
        and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585">RFC6585</a>.</p>
