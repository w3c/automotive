      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This document describes the messaging layer. The separation between transport and messaging layer improves readability and simplify extending VSI to further transports in the future. The VSI messaging layer uses a RESTful design with an interface and a data model.</p>

      <h2>Conformance</h2>
      <p>As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.The key words MAY, MUST, and SHALL are to be interpreted as described in <a href='#rfc2119'>[RFC2119]</a>.</p>

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>The acronym 'VSI' is used to refer to this document, the 'Vehicle Service Interface' specification.The acronym 'VSS' is used to refer to the 'Vehicle Signal Specification' which is defined by the GENIVI Alliance.The term 'WebSocket' when used in this document, is as defined in the W3C WebSocket API and the WebSocket Protocol.</p>

      <section data-dfn-for="Foo">
        <h2>Vehicle Signal Specification</h2>
        <p>The data model used within this specification is the Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS). This defines a 'tree-like' logical taxonomy of the vehicle, (formally a Directed Acyclic Graph), where major vehicle structures (e.g. body, engine) are near the top of the tree and the logical assemblies and components that comprise them, are defined as their child nodes. Each of the child nodes in the tree is further decomposed into its logical constituents, and the process is repeated until leaf nodes are reached. A leaf node is a node at the end of a branch that cannot be decomposed because it represents a single signal or data attribute value. An example VSS tree is shown below, its contents are illustrative:</p>

          <figcaption>Diagram showing an example Vehicle Signal tree.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Within the VSS data model, data sources are named according to their path using a dot notation e.g. engine.rpm. The interface methods defined within this document support path notations as specified by VSS. A path can be appended with a query expression as described in chapter <a href='#query'></a>.</p>

          <p>Vehicle data subscriptions can provide data to the client whenever a signal changes on the server, unless otherwise specified using Server Side Filtering. The server MAY reduce the number of notifications sent to the client in order to reduce processing demands, particularly when the client has subscribed to continuously varying signals.<br>When the client makes a request to the server to create a new subscription, a JSON data object is returned. This object contains the attributes that were passed to the server to make the subscription and a subscriptionId integer handle value which is used to uniquely identify the subscription.

          <h2>Unsubscribe</h2>
          <p>To unsubscribe from a subscription, the client SHALL send an unsubscribe request message to the server, containing the subscriptionId. To unsubscribe to all subscriptions owned by the client, the subscriptionId is set to -1.<br>If the client has created more than one WebSocket instance, it MUST always unsubscribe using the same WebSocket instance that was originally used to create the subscription.<br>It is not possible to unsubscribe from a subset of signals within a subscription. The client must unsubscribe and set up a new subscription to receive notifications for the desired signals.<br>The client should always unsubscribe from receiving notifications when it is no longer using the data. Over a long vehicle journey, this significantly reduces the processing load on the server and allow the server to free memory. It therefore makes it more likely that the server will remain responsive to future requests from the client. If the server is able to satisfy the request it SHALL return a Response message. If an error occurs the server SHALL return an ErrorResponse message. The structure of these message objects are defined below:</p>
