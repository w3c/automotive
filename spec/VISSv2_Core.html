      <p>The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS) is a
      service for accessing vehicle information, signals from sensors
      on control units within a vehicle's network. It exposes this
      information using a hierarchical tree like taxonomy defined in
      GENIVI Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS). The service provides
      this information in JSON format. The service may reside in the
      vehicle for applications needing to analyse a high volume of
      realtime data or on servers in the internet with information
      already brought off the vehicle.</p>

      <p>This specification describes a second version of VISS which
      has been implemented and deployed on production vehicles. It
      adds major new capabilities and improvements to the earlier
      version. The first version of VISS only supported WebSocket as a
      transport protocol, the second version is generalized to work
      across different protocols as some are better suited for
      different use cases. HTTP is now supported with additional
      protocols used within the automotive industry being evaluated
      for inclusion. Subscription capabilities have been improved and
      access control has been added.</p>
      
      <p>
        There are two parts to this specification, Core and Transport. This document, the VISS version 2 CORE specification, describes the VISSv2 messaging layer. 
        The companion specifications for the VISSv2 transport protocols detail the mapping of the messaging layer to selected transports.
        The ontologies based on the VISSv2 core specification are defined in documents for each specific domain
        (e.g. navigation, media, vehicle data).

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document describes the messaging API for VISS protocol. 
        This includes the messaging layer and set of rules for structuring data.
        The separation between payload encoding (transport) and messaging API (core) improves adaptability. 
        Extending and describing multiple transport protocols becomes possible.
      </p>     
      <p>
        The messages are exchanged between a server implementation holding the representation of data 
        and a client using the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The VISSv2 messaging layer uses a RESTful design for all methods exchanged via the interface (<a href="#interface"></a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        The VISSv2 data structuring rules (<a href="http://genivi.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/">VSS Rule set</a>) are the same through all transport protocols.
        The basis for structuring data hold by a server is a tree.

    <section id="data-model">
      <h2>Data Model</h2>
		<p>The service is intended for use with a tree-like logical taxonomy to represent the vehicle data. 
		An illustrative example of such a tree structure is shown in <a href="#fig-example-vss-tree">Figure 1</a>. 
		While it is meant to support conforming taxonomies it was created principally with the 
		<a href="https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification">Vehicle Signal Specification</a> (VSS) in mind. 
		For more details, see the <a href="http://genivi.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/">VSS documentation</a>.

        </figure>

      <section id="address">
        <h2>Addressing</h2>
        <p>Addressing of elements is done using URIs as defined in [[RFC3986]].</p>
        <blockquote><a>scheme</a>:<a>authority</a>/<a>path</a>?<a>query</a></blockquote>
        <p>The <dfn>scheme</dfn> describes the protocol to use to reach the addressed element.</p>
        <p>The <dfn>authority</dfn> describes where to reach the server holding and managing the data representation.
          Scheme and authority are defined within the protocol adaptation.</p>
        <p>The <dfn>path</dfn> consists a sequence of VSS node names separated by a delimiter. VSS specifies the dot (.) as delimiter, 
        so that is the recommended choice also in this specification. 
        However, in HTTP URLs the conventional delimiter is slash (/), therefore this delimiter is also supported. 
        To exemplify this, the path expression from traversing the nodes Vehicle, Car, Engine, RPM can  be "Vehicle.Car.Engine.RPM", 
        or "Vehicle/Car/Engine/RPM". A mix of delimiters in the same path expression SHOULD be avoided.<br>
        The path may contain the wildcard character (*) as a representative for one path segment. 
        It MUST not be combined with other characters to express the path segment, such as "Vehicle.C*". Multiple wildcards may be used in the same path, such as "Vehicle.Cabin.Door.*.*.IsOpen".
        </p>
        <p>The <dfn>query</dfn> contains further information related to the request, see <a href="#filter-request"></a>.

      <section id="methods">
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>
          The transport protocols used to implement these methods MUST implement the Read and Update methods, and MAY implement the Subscribe, Unsubscribe, and Subscription methods.

	<p>In addition to some privacy provisions within the

	creating an accompanying <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/autowebplatform/wiki/Best_Practices">In-Vehicle Application Best Practices</a>
	document to provide further considerations for handling of
	information. These Best Practices go beyond the narrow scope
	of this specification and addresses several of the concerns
	for the broader telematics ecosystems it is a part of. These
	practices include reducing ability to fingerprint an
	individual or vehicle from its data, providing data use
	consent, revokation, integrity and use audit accountability.</p>

	<p>For some uses, such as when information is only referenced within the vehicle not sent
	off nor persisting between restarts, there should be little to
	no privacy concerns.</p>
	
        <p>This specification, unlike its predecessor, has granular
        access control capabilities to limit what information an
        application may access. All information sent from a VISS
        service to client application must be transported over an
        encrypted protocol to help protect privacy.
        </p>

	<p>For an application to be installed and permitted to run on a vehicle it should
	have consent from whoever is deemed authoritative for a given
	jurisdiction and ownership situation. That consent should be
	revocable. Consent and revoking it are outside the scope of
	this specification, we expect that to be handled out of band
	and in some cases by regulations and contractual commitments. Future version of this specification however may provide
	mechanism for enabling and suspending application
	authorization to access information.</p>

        <h2>Paths Filter Operation</h2>
		<p>
		The paths filter operation is used when a single request is used to retrieve signal data from multiple data points in the VSS tree. 
		The vsspath shall point to the last node in the tree that is common for the relative paths in the filter op-value, that start off from this node. 
		If the end point of a path in the filter op-value is a branch, then all leaf nodes in the sub-tree below this branch are addressed.
		A path in the filter op-value may contain the wildcard character (*) as a representative for a path segment.<br>
		Every path element in an op-value array must address at least one node in the tree, or else an error response is returned.<br>
		If the path in the filter op-value ends with one or more wildcards, then only the leaf nodes with path segments matching the number of wildcards are addressed. 
		Different elements of the op-value array may address the same node, in which case it is the responsibility of the server to resolve this to a singleton in the notifications.<br>
		If the op-value contains a single path then it shall not be enclosed with JSON array brackets.<br>
		The op-extra key-value pair is not used in paths filter operations.<br>

     <section id="history-filter-operation">
        <h2>History Filter Operation</h2>
		<p>
		The server typically have access only to the latest, most fresh data point representing a signal. 
		However, it may for various reasons at least temporarily have access to also older data points. 
		A scenario where this could occur is when a vehicle temporarily loses its connectivity, 
		maybe because it enters into a tunnel. Assuming that the vehicle detects the loss of connectivity, it may then start to record data. 
		If recorded, this data may then be accessed using the history op-type. 
		The vehicle system makes its own decision whether to record any data, and for how long this data will be kept in storage. 
		The period goes from current time, excluding the current value, and backwards in time. 
		The number of data points in the response depends on the period size, and the sample frequency. 
		The latter can not be set by the client, so the client should have some understanding of its value to estimate the amount of data it may receive. 
		A request for historic data will return a Not found error (404) if historic data is unavailable. 
		The period must conform to the [[ISO8601]] duration format, expressed with days, hour, minute, and second data, i. e. "op-value": "PdddDThhHmmMssS".
		The number of days shall be less than 999. Only a single period can be expressed.<br>
		The op-extra key-value pair is not used in history filter operations.<br>
		Examples can be found in the TRANSPORT specification.

     <section id="capture-filter-operation">
          <h2>Capture Filter Operation</h2>
		<p>
		The capture filter operation is used when the client want to restrict the amount of data that will be returned. 
		The op-extra key-value pair is used in capture filter operations, as described for the following capture types below.
		<ul>
		<li>time-based: the op-extra contains the period time X in between captures, {"period":"X"}.</li>
		<li>range: the op-extra contains the range boundary, and the logical operator, {"logic-op":"X", "boundary": "Y"}, 
		where X is one of the supported logical operators (**), and Y boundary of the range.
		The op-extra may be an array of two of these objects, combined through a logical AND to support expressions of a bounded range. 
		A range event is triggered both when the filter expression becomes "true", and when it becomes "false".</li>
		<li>change: the op-extra contains the the logical operator for comparison of previous and current values, {"logic-op":"X", "diff":"Y"}, 
		where X is one of the supported logical operators (**), and Y is the value of the required change.</li>
		<li>curve-logging: the op-extra contains the maximum error limit, and the buffer size, {"max-err": "X", "buf-size":"Y"}, 
		where X is a float value setting the max allowed error between any data sample and the simplified curve, 
		and Y is the number of buffer elements. Data is processed when the buffer becomes full, and the essential data points are returned as a time series per signal. 
		For more information on curve logging, please see <a href="https://github.com/Geotab/curve">Curve logging library</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		(**)The supported logical operators are ["eq", "ne", "gt", "gte", "lt", "lte"], 
		where "eq" is "equal", "ne" is "not equal", "gt" is "greater than", "gte" is "greater than or equal", "lt" is "less than", "lte" is "less than or equal".<br>

   <section id="metadata-request">
     <h2>Metadata Filter Operation</h2>
	<p>
	Metadata requests are used when the client instead of the data associated to VSS node(s) wants to retrieve meta data associated to the VSS node(s).<br>
	Two categories of metadata are defined, "static-metadata" and "dynamic-metadata". 
	The former contains the metadata found in the VSS tree as specified on the VSS repo, while the latter contains metadata that is additional to the referred VSS specification.<br>
	The client selects which of the categories that is requested by setting the "op-value" to either "static" or "dynamic".
	These requests are sometimes referred to as a signal discovery request.
	The "dynamic-metadata" may change over time, which is not the case for the "static-metadata".
	If the "op-extra" key value pair is not used, then all metadata that the server can retrieve for the respective category is returned, 
	while if it used then only the selected metadata as expressed in the "op-extra" is returned. 
	If the expression contains multiple metadata types, then they are concatenated with a plus sign (+) as delimiter. <br><br>
	For the set of static metadata key names, see the <a href="https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification">Vehicle Signal Specification</a>.<br><br>
	The set of dynamic metadata keynames are found in the list below. If a corresponding value to a key name is not present, the key-value pair is omitted in the response.
	<ul>
	<li>sample-rate: the native capture frequency in Hz that is used by the vehicle system.</li>
	<li>capture-filter: the capture filter operation that the vehicle system is configured for.</li>
	<li>availability: the current availability of a signal. The possible values are ["available", "unavailable", "error"]. 
	The unavailable status is returned when the signal is inaccessible due to the current vehicle state. 
	The error status is returned if the subsystem represented by the signal exists in the vehice, but is broken and requires repair.</li>
	<li>validate: the access control rule that is applied to the node and its sub-tree. 
	The server response shall conform to the inheritance rules, see the access control selection chapter.</li>
	</ul>
	A metadata request can be combined with a paths filter operation to address multiple nodes, but not with a capture filter operation.<br>
	The response is a JSON formatted object with corresponding key-value pairs per addressed node.<br>
	Examples can be found in the TRANSPORT specification.

     </section>

     <section id="response-syntax">
          <h2>Response syntax</h2>
	    <p>
	    A response may contain multiple values, due to either that multiple nodes are addressed, or to that multiple values for one signal is returned.
	    These two reasons can be combined, leading to four different cases.
		<ul>
		<li>Request for a single value from a single node.</li>
		<li>Request for multiple values from a single node.</li>
		<li>Request for a single value from multiple nodes.</li>
		<li>Request for multiple values from multiple nodes.</li>
		</ul>
		The syntax to accomodate these four cases have a common structure where a data point ("dp") consists of one or more objects containing a "value" and a timestamp ("ts"), 
		and the complete aggregation ("data"), consists of one or more objects containing a "path" and a data point (dp"). The syntax of the four cases are shown below.
              <pre><code>
		“data”:{“path”:”X”, “dp”:{“value”:”Y”, “ts”:”Z”}}
		“data”:{“path”:”X”, “dp”: [{“value”:”Y1”, “ts”:”Z1”}, …, {“value”:”Yn”, “ts”:”Zn”}]}
		“data”:[{“path”:”X1”, “dp”:{“value”:”Y1”, “ts”:”Z1”}}, …, {“path”:”Xm”, “dp”:{“value”:”Ym”, “ts”:”Zm”}}]
		“data”:[{“path”:”X1”, “dp”:[{“value”:”Y11”, “ts”:”Z11”}, …, {“value”:”Y1n”, “ts”:”Z1n”}]}, …, {“path”:”Xm”, “dp”:[{“value”:”Ym1”, “ts”:”Zm1”}, …, {“value”:”Ymn”, “ts”:”Zmn”}]}]
              </code></pre>
               In the case of a request for multiple values from multiple nodes, the datapoint for different paths may contain single or multiple objects, 
               as the vehicle system may not have multiple values recorded for all requested signals.

     <section id="subscription-notification-triggering">
          <h2>Subscription Notification Triggering</h2>
	    <p>
	    A subscription request must always contain a capture filter operation that describes the trigger event that leads to that the server dispatches an asynchronous notification message.
	    For the capture types "range" or "change", the triggering is dependent on the signal value. 
	    When the request addresses multiple signals, the triggering condition shall only be evaluated on one of the signals, which is the first signal in the op-value array of paths. 
	    The first path in the array must therefore not contain wildcards to address multiple signals. 
	    In this case one of the path addresses in the wildcard expression must be selected as the first array element, which can then be followed by the wildcard expression. 
	    The duplicate reference to one signal that this leads to shall be resolved by the server to a singleton in the notifications.

      <p>
      Access control MUST be supported. However, in this chapter only the sections that describe the interactions between the <a href="#client-def">client</a> and the VISSv2 server are normative.

      <section id="architecture">
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
        The VISSv2 access control model is inspired by the concepts of OAuth2.0 [[RFC6749]], but some deviations exist as is described in the following chapters.<br><br>
        Four actors are defined:<br>
        <b>Client</b><br>
        An <a href="#application-roles-def">application </a>making protected and authorized resource requests on behalf of its <a href="#user-roles-def">user</a>.<br>
        <b>Access Grant server</b><br>
        The server issuing the Access Grant credential after successfully authenticating the <a href="#client-def">client</a>.<br>
        <b>Access Token server</b><br>
        The server issuing the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> to the <a href="#client-def">client</a> after successfully validating the request and obtaining authorization.<br>
        <b>VISSv2 server</b><br>
        The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using <a href="#access-token-def">access tokens</a>.<br><br>
        The abstract protocol flow illustrated in the figure below describes the interaction between the four actors.<br>
        <figure id="fig-oauth2.0-flow">
          <img src="images/VISSv2-abstract-flow.jpg" alt="VISSv2 abstract protocol flow.">
          <figcaption> <span class="fig-title">The abstract protocol flow.</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        Besides the four actors directly involved in the abstract flow, there are two more actors.<br>
        <b>Resource owner</b><br>
        This is typically the driver of the vehicle, who may be asked for consent before access is granted.<br>
        <b>Ecosystem manager</b><br>
        The entity managing the access control ecosystem. It controls the Policy documents, and manages the PKI ecosystem that the other actors may utilize.<br><br>
        The abstract protocol flow is implemented by two different flows, as will be described in the following chapters.<br>
        The process to obtain the credentials needed for <a href="#client-def">client</a> authentication is out-of-scope, as well as the installation procedures for the <a href="#application-roles-def">applications</a>.

        <h2>Protocol Flows</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
        Two different flows are described. Which flow to use depends on the capabilities of the <a href="#client-def">client</a>.<br>If a <a href="#client-def">client</a> is able to run public key cryptographic primitives, 
        i.e. key pair generation and signatures, and has access to some kind of trusted execution environment where private keys are protected from the regular execution environment, 
        then it can use the long term flow. <a href="#client-def">Clients</a> that do not have access to these capabilities, or do not want to use them, must select the short term flow.<br>
        The advantage of using the long term flow is that the <a href="#client-def">client</a> can be trusted with longer expiry times of <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>. 
        In the short term flow the <a href="#client-def">client</a> must due to a shorter expiry time contact the <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant server</a> more often to obtain a new <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>.<br>
        A <a href="#client-def">client</a> selects the type of flow by either submitting a public key in the <a href="#access-grant-request-def">access grant request</a>, or not. The latter leading to an short term flow.

        <h2>Access Grant Server</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
          The access arant server is in charge of producing <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a> to <a href="#client-def">clients</a>.<br>
          Depending on the capabilities of the <a href="#client-def">client</a>, the specification supports two types of <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>: Short term and long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>.<br>
          Long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>, are supported for those <a href="#client-def">clients</a> able to run public key cryptographic primitives, i.e. key pair generation and signatures, 
          and is the recommended choice for <a href="#client-def">clients</a> with access to a trusted execution environment where private keys are protected from the regular execution environment. 
          The specification also supports short term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a> that require no extra capabilities in the client, 
          but due to its shorter expiry time it forces the client to contact the access grant server more often before <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a> requests for an <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a>.<br>
          The <a href="#client-def">client</a> request shall contain the following:
          <ul>
            <li>A VIN.</li>
            <li>A <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a>.</li>
            <li>A set of <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proofs</a>.</li>
          </ul> 
          If the <a href="#client-def">client</a> needs a long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>, then the request shall also contain:
          <ul>
            <li>A public key.</li>
          </ul> 
          The Vehicle identification number shall be for the vehicle that the <a href="#client-def">client</a> wants to access.<br>
          The <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a> contains all relevant information from the client, i.e. for each of the three sub-actors that the <a href="#client-def">client</a> represents.<br>
          The <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proofs</a> are to be used for verifying the <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a>.<br>
          The public key shall be generated by the <a href="#client-def">client</a>, and the associated private key must be under control of the <a href="#client-def">client</a>.<br><br>
        The main responsibilities of the access grant server are:
          <ul>
            <li>To verify the <a href="#client-context-def"> client context</a>, and assess that their respective role request can be granted.</li>
            <li>To check that the vehicle represented by the VIN belong to this Ecosystem, and is accessible.</li>
            <li>To create an <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          The <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proofs</a> may include certificates from a Certificate Authority known by the access grant server. For example, 
          users might authenticate themselves using X.509 identity certificates and roles might be issued using attribute certificates. In those cases, as part of the authentication protocol, 
          the access grant server shall also validate the certificates signatures.<br>
          The access grant server may contact the <a href="#ecosystem-manager-def">ecosystem manager</a> for checking the VIN.<br>
          The <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> generation is defined in the corresponding chapter.

        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
        The <a href="#client-def">client</a> shall after a successful interaction with the <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant server</a> request an <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> from the access token server. 
        The <a href="#client-def">client</a> request shall contain at least these two parameters below.
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#access-grant-token-def">Access grant token</a>.</li>
            <li><a>Purpose</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        For long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>, i.e. those including a public key, the <a href="#client-def">client</a> must also include a <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proof of possession</a>, for the corresponding private key, in the request.<br>
        The <a>purpose</a> must be supported by the <a href="#ecosystem-manager-def">ecosystem manager</a>, and thus be on the <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a>. 
        The <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a> associates a set of accessible signals to the <a>purpose</a>, thus realizing the principle of least privilege.<br>
        The main responsibilities of the access token server are:
          <ul>
            <li>To validate the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>.</li>
            <li>To validate that the <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a> provides permission for the requested <a>purpose</a>.</li>
            <li>To create an <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        The validation of the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> consists of at least the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Signature validation.</li>
            <li>Expiry time check.</li>
          </ul>
        Additionally, for long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>, the access token server needs to verify the <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proof of possession</a> using the public key contained in the token.<br>
        The <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> signature validation is done with the <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant server</a> public key. 
        <br>
        To allow for some time synchronization inaccuracy and minor network latency, expiry times should be set to include potential modest margin of error, possibly as long as tens of seconds.<br>
        If the <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a> as declared in the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> does not match in the set of allowed roles for the requested <a>purpose</a> in the <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a>, 
        then the <a href="#client-def">client</a> request for an <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> must be denied.<br>

        <h2>Access Control Server</h2>
        <p>
        The VISSv2 server MUST support validation of <a href="#access-token-def">access tokens</a>. The functionality needed for this is decribed in this chapter.
        This includes validation of at least the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Token signature.</li>
            <li>Token expiry time.</li>

          </ul>
          If any of the mentioned validations above fail, the server MUST reject the access request.<br>
          Token signature validation may be delegated to the <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a>, if a secure communication link can be established.
          If not delegated, then a preprovisioned common secret may be shared with the <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a>, or other PKI based solutions may be used.<br>
          The VISSv2 server SHALL have access to a secure system time, that cannot be modified by actors without system acknowledged credentials. 
          Time validation may allow for a time synchronization inaccuracy in the range of tens of seconds.<br>
          A successful scope validation requires that all the nodes addressed by the path in the request MUST 
          be matched by the paths associated with the <a>purpose</a> in the scope claim of the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a>.<br>
          Validation of the <a href="#device-roles-def">device</a> and <a href="#application-roles-def">app </a>roles may involve MAC address checks, or message round-trip measurements.<br>
          The access mode validation MUST have the outcome shown in the table below, 
          when comparing the type of the <a href="#client-def">client</a> request with the access control mode in the <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a> that is associated to the scope claim in the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a>.

          <h2>Proof of Possession</h2>
          <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>

          <p>
            Long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a> need to be accompanied by a Proof of Possession (PoP) for the private key corresponding to the public key included in the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>. 
            This requirement enables a longer validity for this kind of tokens, ranging from a few days to a even a year.
            By adding the PoP, we prevent an eavesdropper to reuse an <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> request, impersonating the client. Without a PoP, the longer the validity of an <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>, 
            the higher the risk an attacker could intercept and reuse it.
            PoP for JWT are defined in [[RFC7800]], but in essence, a PoP enables the requester to proof to the server that it has access to a private key, without disclosing it. 
            Traditionally that would require the server to create a random challenge, or nonce, and ask the client to sign it with its private key. Along with the public key, 
            the server would be able to verify the PoP.
            This scheme would require an extra step in the protocols, where the client ask for the nonce.
          </p><p>
            In order to avoid this extra step, the client can generate the nonce itself. The server would need to check that nonces are not reused. 
            Although logging previous nonces at the server side would work for small environments, we propose the use of an incremental nonce in the form of a timestamp. 
            One of the drawbacks of this proposal is that the server has no means to check whether the PoP has been precomputed or not. 
            However, this is irrelevant from the eavesdropper point of view.
          </p><p>
            In case freshness of the PoP was a critical requirement, we could use a public source of randomness to obtain the nonce, 
            e.g. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/leagueofentropy/">Leage of Entropy</a> or 
            <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/interoperable-randomness-beacons">Interoperable Randomness Beacons</a>.

        <h2>Client Context</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
        The <a href="#client-def">client</a> actor is characterized by three subactors:
          <ul>
            <li>The <a href="#user-roles-def">user</a> of the application.</li>
            <li>The <a href="#application-roles-def">application</a>.</li>
            <li>The <a href="#device-roles-def">device</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          Each of these subactors is in turn characterized by a role, 
          building on the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model</a>. 
          The set of these three roles is called the Client context.<br>
          VISSv2 specifies a rudimentary list of roles for each subactor, it is expected that these lists are augmented by the <a href="#ecosystem-manager-def">ecosystem manager</a>, hopefully in a cooperative effort.<br>
          Using an RBAC model provides the following main purposes in the VISSv2 access control model:
          <ul>
            <li>Input to the <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant server</a> in the <a href="#client-def">client</a> authentication process.</li>
            <li>Input to the <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a> in the <a>purpose</a> validation.</li>
          </ul>
        The <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant server</a> must in the authentication process of the client possibly separately authenticate each of the three subactors. 
        For the <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant server</a> to decide on which authentication method to use per subactor can be quite complex, but may be somewhat eased by the <a href="#client-def">client</a> request for roles for each subactor.<br>
        Following the principle of least priviledge, a <a href="#client-def">client</a> should not have access to more vehicle signals than necessary. 
        This is achieved by the <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a>, that assigns only the for the <a>purpose</a> relevant signals to the <a href="#client-def">client</a>.

        <h2>Access Control Selection</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
        This chapter describes a complementary functionality to the access control model, the ability to apply it selectively to parts of the tree. 
        It can be used in cases where not all nodes of the tree are believed to require access control, 
        or read-only is sufficient instead of read-write access control for certain nodes.<br>
        This functionality requires that the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> specifies whether the access granted to the <a href="#client-def">client</a> to a signal is read-only, or read-write.
        It also requires that the metadata for the node in the VSS tree contains data specifying whether the access control verification should be carried out only for write request, 
        or for both read and write requests.<br>
        The former requirement is realized as described in earlier chapters by that the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> scope claim links to a <a>purpose</a> 
        where the signals and their respective access mode are found.<br>
        The latter requirement is realized by adding to nodes in the VSS tree the key-value pair "validate":'access-control-mode', 
        where 'access-control-mode' is either the string "write-only", or "read-write".<br>
        <figure id="fig-access-control-selection">
          <img src="images/access-control-selection.jpg" alt="Access control selection tagging.">
          <figcaption> <span class="fig-title">Access control selection tagging.</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        The figure above shows an example where both read and write requests to the three leftmost leaf nodes will be access controlled, 
        while the two rightmost leaf nodes only will be access controlled for write requests. 
        An inheritance rule leads to that any nodes below a tagged node are assigned the same access control, if they are untagged.<br>
        This metadata is not likely to be applied to the standardised VSS tree, as different implementers of this standard may have different views on which nodes to apply it to. 
        Instead it is anticipated that it is applied at a "deployment" stage, possibly using the VSS layering concept.<br>
        The inheritance model, which says that if access-control-mode data is added to a node, then all nodes in the subtree for which this node is the root inherits the setting, 
        unless there is access-control-mode data added to any node in this subtree, makes possible a reduction of the number of nodes this metadata have to be added to.<br>
        This allows for example an entire VSS tree to be assigned an access-control-mode by merely applying it in the root of the tree.<br>
        The figure below shows an overview of the access control selection model, 
        and a table showing the required access control tagging of a node for the VISSv2 server to grant the requested access. 
        <figure id="fig-access-control-selection-model">
          <img src="images/access-control-selection-model.jpg" alt="Access control selection model.">
          <figcaption> <span class="fig-title">Access control selection model.</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        If the VSS tree used by a VISSv2 server contains access control selection tags, then the server MUST support their usage as described in this chapter.<br>
        If it is not used, then a server may implement access control for the entire tree.<br>
