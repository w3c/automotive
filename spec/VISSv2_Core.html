      <p>The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS) is a
      service for accessing vehicle information, signals from sensors
      on control units within a vehicle's network. It exposes this
      information using a hierarchical tree like taxonomy defined in
      GENIVI Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS). The service provides
      this information in JSON format. The service may reside in the
      vehicle for applications needing to analyse a high volume of
      realtime data or on servers in the internet with information
      already brought off the vehicle.</p>

      <p>This specification describes a second version of VISS which
      has been implemented and deployed on production vehicles. It
      adds major new capabilities and improvements to the earlier
      version. The first version of VISS only supported WebSocket as a
      transport protocol, the second version is generalized to work
      across different protocols as some are better suited for
      different use cases. HTTP is now supported with additional
      protocols used within the automotive industry being evaluated
      for inclusion. Subscription capabilities have been improved and
      access control has been added.</p>
      
      <p>
        There are two parts to this specification, Core and Transport. This document, the VISS version 2 CORE specification, 
        describes the VISSv2 messaging layer. 
        The companion specifications for the VISSv2 transport protocols detail the mapping of the messaging layer to selected transports.
        The ontologies based on the VISSv2 core specification are defined in documents for each specific domain
        (e.g. navigation, media, vehicle data). 
      </p>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document describes the messaging API for VISS protocol. 
        This includes the messaging layer and set of rules for structuring data.
        The separation between payload encoding (transport) and messaging API (core) improves adaptability. 
        Extending and describing multiple transport protocols becomes possible.
      </p>     
      <p>
        The messages are exchanged between a server implementation holding the representation of data 
        and a client using the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The VISSv2 messaging layer uses a RESTful design for all methods exchanged via the interface (<a href="#interface"></a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        The VISSv2 data structuring rules (<a href="http://genivi.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/">VSS Rule set</a>) 
        are the same through all transport protocols.
        The basis for structuring data hold by a server is a tree.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>The acronym 'VISSv2' is used to refer to this document, the VISS version 2 specification. 
      The acronym 'VSS' is used to refer to the 'Vehicle Signal Specification' which is hosted by the GENIVI Alliance. 
      The term 'WebSocket' when used in this document, is as defined in the 
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/">W3C WebSocket API</a> and [[RFC6455]], the WebSocket Protocol.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>
                <p>The service is intended for use with a tree-like logical taxonomy to represent the vehicle data. 
                An illustrative example of such a tree structure is shown in <a href="#fig-example-vss-tree">Figure 1</a>. 
                While it is meant to support conforming taxonomies it was created principally with the 
                <a href="https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification">Vehicle Signal Specification</a> (VSS) in mind. 
                For more details, see the <a href="http://genivi.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/">VSS documentation</a>.

        </figure>

      <section id="address">
        <h2>Addressing</h2>
        <p>Addressing of resources is done using URIs as defined in [[RFC3986]].<br>
        <blockquote><a>scheme</a>://<a>authority</a>/<a>path</a>?<a>query</a></blockquote>
        The <dfn>scheme</dfn> describes the protocol to use to reach the addressed resource.
        For supported protocols, see the TRANSPORT specification.<br>
        The <dfn>authority</dfn> describes where to reach the resource, for more details see <a href="#authority-component"></a>.<br>
        The <dfn>path</dfn> addresses a specific service within the resource, for more details see <a href="#path-component"></a>.<br>
        The <dfn>query</dfn> contains further information related to the addressed service, see <a href="#filter-request"></a>.<br>
        There are potentially three resources for which a client needs a URI, see <a href="#architecture"></a>:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>VISSv2 server.</li>
            <li>Access grant token server.</li>
            <li>Access token server.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

      <section id="authority-component">
        <h2>Authority URI Component</h2>
        <p>
          The authority component of the URI consists of an IP address or a domain name followed by a colon and a port number. 
        </p>

        <section id="ip-address-domain-name">
          <h2>IP address / domain name</h2>
          <p>
          Depending on the deployment of a resource, either in the cloud or in a vehicle, they will have a domain name or an IP address, respectively. 
          A client is expected to obtain this part of the authority component via an interaction with the 
          <a href="#ecosystem-manager-def">ecosystem manager</a>. The details of this interaction is out of scope for this specification.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="port-number">
          <h2>Port number</h2>
          <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
          <p>
          The VISSv2 server shall use the following port numbers for the different transport protocols.
          <ul>
            <li>HTTP port number = 443.</li>
            <li>Websocket port number = 6443.</li>
            <li>MQTT port number = 8883.</li>
          </ul>
          The access grant token server shall use the port number 7443.<br>
          The access token server shall use the port number 8443.<br>
          A client may be provisioned with other port numbers than the above specified in its interaction 
          to obtain the other parts of the authority component, see <a href="#ip-address-domain-name"></a>.
          </p>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section id="path-component">
        <h2>Path URI Component</h2>
        <p>
          The path URI component definition differs between the three resources.<br>
          For the <b>VISSv2 server</b> the definition is as follows.<br>
          The path consists a sequence of VSS node names separated by a delimiter. VSS specifies the dot (.) as delimiter, 
          which therefore is the recommended choice also in this specification. 
          However, in HTTP URLs the conventional delimiter is slash (/), therefore also this delimiter is supported. 
          To exemplify, the path expression from traversing the nodes Vehicle, Car, Engine, RPM can  be "Vehicle.Car.Engine.RPM", 
          or "Vehicle/Car/Engine/RPM". A mix of delimiters in the same path expression SHOULD be avoided.<br>
          The path MUST not contain any wildcard characters ("*"), for such needs see <a href="#paths-filter-operation"></a>.<br>
          For the <b>access grant token server</b> the path is "agts".<br>
          For the <b>access token server</b> the path is "ats".<br>
        </p>
      </section>
      </section>

      <section id="data-representation">
        <h2>Data representation</h2>
        <p>
          This specification excludes "number" and "null" from the list of supported values that [[RFC8259]] declares. 
          The supported JSON value alternatives are thus:<br>
          value = false / true / object / array / string<br>
          A consequence of this is that number values MUST be represented as strings. 
          The format of these number strings MUST follow the number formats as specified in [[RFC8259]].
          If data is represented incorrectly, then an error message with number 400, and reason "Bad data" MUST be returned. 
          A specific case of this is if an array of data elements does not contain the number expected by the server. 
          The server MAY then respond successfully, and follow a proprietary recovery policy, 
          or it MAY respond with error number 400, and reason "Invalid array size".

        document to provide further considerations for handling of
        information. These Best Practices go beyond the narrow scope
        of this specification and addresses several of the concerns
        for the broader telematics ecosystems it is a part of. These
        practices include reducing ability to fingerprint an
        individual or vehicle from its data, providing data use
        consent, revokation, integrity and use audit accountability.</p>

        <p>For some uses, such as when information is only referenced within the vehicle not sent
        off nor persisting between restarts, there should be little to
        no privacy concerns.</p>
        
        <p>This specification, unlike its predecessor, has granular
        access control capabilities to limit what information an
        application may access. All information sent from a VISS
        service to client application must be transported over an
        encrypted protocol to help protect privacy.

        have consent from whoever is deemed authoritative for a given

        revocable. Consent and revoking it are outside the scope of
        this specification, we expect that to be handled out of band
        and in some cases by regulations and contractual commitments. Future version of this specification however may provide
        mechanism for enabling and suspending application
        authorization to access information.</p>

      <h2>Filter Request</h2>
          <p>
          Filtering is a mechanism to refine a client request, in order to more precisely control what is returned in a response. 
          Filtering can be applied in read requests and in subscribe requests. 
          A request where filtering is applied has the following structure
          <ul>
          <li>for the HTTP protocol:
          <ul>
          <li>GET /&lt;vsspath&gt;?filter=&lt;json-expression&gt;</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>for the Websocket protocol:
          <ul>
          <li>{"action":"get", "path":"&lt;vsspath&gt;", "filter":"&lt;JSON-expression&gt;"}</li>
          </ul></li>
          </ul>
          where<br>
          <ul>
          <li>Get is the transport protocol method,</li>
          <li>vsspath is the path starting from the tree root,</li>
          <li>filter is the key name for the filter expression,</li>
          <li>json-expression contains the filter instructions.</li>
          </ul>
          </ul>
          The JSON expression has the object format as shown below. For the case of an optional second object of this type, 
          these are enclosed in an array expression.<br>
          <ul>
          <li>{"type":"&lt;x&gt;", "value":"&lt;y&gt;"}</li>
          </ul>
          where<br>
          <ul>
          <li><b>type</b>: the key name for the filter operation type, which can have one of the values:
          <ul>
          <li><u>paths</u>:
          <ul>
          <li>one or more relative paths. In the case of several paths an array expression shall be used.</li>
          </ul></li>

          <ul>
          <li>data is captured repeatedly with a fixed period time.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li><u>range</u>:
          <ul>
          <li>data is captured when values are in the given range.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li><u>change</u>:
          <ul>
          <li>data is captured when the value since last capture has changed more than a fixed value.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li><u>curvelog</u>:
          <ul>
          <li>captured data is processed according to the curve logging algorithm before being sent to client.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li><u>history</u>:
          <ul>
          <li>the time period from current time and backwards in time.</li>

          <ul>
          <li>the response contains the VSS metadata of the addressed sub-tree.</li>

          <li><u>dynamic-metadata</u>:
          <ul>
          <li>the response contains metadata additional to the VSS specification.</li>
          </ul></li>
          </ul></li>
          <li><b>value</b>: the key name for the optional configuration data that the filter operation requires. 
          The value data varies depending on the type, 
          is enclosed in one object, or optionally an array of two objects, and is described in the following chapters.</li>
          </ul>
          The server MUST support the timebased and change types, the other types are optional.<br>
          In the JSON object, the key-value pairs "type" and "value" must always be present.
          The JSON expression may consist of maximum one object with type "paths", plus maximum one object with any other supported type, 
          which are then logically combined as with an AND operator.<br>
          The types timebased, range, change, and curvelog are only applicable for subscription requests. 
          Subscription requests are supported by the websocket and the MQTT transport protocols.<br>
          The restriction on how many objects that can be combined is also set by the URL size restriction on 1k characters (*).<br>
          (*) 1k is the "conservative limit, which should always be supported, a more liberal limit is 2k, which is supported in most cases.

     <section id="paths-filter-operation">
        <h2>Paths Filter Operation</h2>
                <p>
                The paths filter operation is used when a single request is used to retrieve signal data from multiple data points in the VSS tree. 
                The vsspath shall point to the last node in the tree that is common for the relative paths in the filter value, 
                that start off from this node. 
                If the end point of a path in the filter value is a branch, then all leaf nodes in the sub-tree below this branch are addressed.
                A path in the filter value may contain the wildcard character (*) as a representative for a path segment.<br>
                Every path element in an value array must address at least one node in the tree, or else an error response is returned.<br>
                If the path in the filter value ends with one or more wildcards, 
                then only the leaf nodes with path segments matching the number of wildcards are addressed. 
                Different elements of the value array may address the same node, 
                in which case it is the responsibility of the server to resolve this to a singleton in the notifications.<br>
                If the value contains a single path then it shall not be enclosed with JSON array brackets.<br>
                Examples can be found in the TRANSPORT specification.

     <section id="history-filter-operation">
        <h2>History Filter Operation</h2>
                <p>
                The server typically have access only to the latest, most fresh data point representing a signal. 
                However, it may for various reasons at least temporarily have access to also older data points. 
                A scenario where this could occur is when a vehicle temporarily loses its connectivity, 
                maybe because it enters into a tunnel. Assuming that the vehicle detects the loss of connectivity, it may then start to record data. 
                If recorded, this data may then be accessed using the history type. 
                The vehicle system makes its own decision whether to record any data, and for how long this data will be kept in storage. 
                The period goes from current time, excluding the current value, and backwards in time. 
                The number of data points in the response depends on the period size, and the sample frequency. 
                The latter can not be set by the client, 
                so the client should have some understanding of its value to estimate the amount of data it may receive. 
                A request for historic data will return a Not found error (404) if historic data is unavailable. 
                The period must conform to the [[ISO8601]] duration format, expressed with days, hour, minute, 
                and second data, i. e. "value": "PdddDThhHmmMssS".
                The number of days shall be less than 999. Only a single period can be expressed.<br>

          <h2>Subscription Notification Triggering</h2>
            <p>
            A subscription request must always contain a filter operation that describes the trigger event that leads to 
            that the server dispatches an asynchronous notification message.
            For the filter types "range" or "change", the triggering is dependent on the signal value. 
            When the request addresses multiple signals, the triggering condition shall only be evaluated on one of the signals, 
            which is the first signal in the value array of paths. 
            The first path in the array must therefore not contain wildcards to address multiple signals. 
            In this case one of the path addresses in the wildcard expression must be selected as the first array element, 
            which can then be followed by the wildcard expression. 
            The duplicate reference to one signal that this leads to shall be resolved by the server to a singleton in the notifications.

      Access control SHALL not be applied to the VSS nodes containing the VSS version data,

      <section id="architecture">
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
        The VISSv2 access control model is inspired by the concepts of OAuth2.0 [[RFC6749]], 
        but some deviations exist as is described in the following chapters.<br><br>
        Four actors are defined:<br>
        <b>Client</b><br>
        An <a href="#application-roles-def">application </a>making protected and authorized resource requests on behalf of its 
        <a href="#user-roles-def">user</a>.<br>
        <b>Access grant token server</b><br>
        The server issuing the Access Grant credential after successfully authenticating the <a href="#client-def">client</a>.<br>
        <b>Access token server</b><br>
        The server issuing the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> to the <a href="#client-def">client</a> 
        after successfully validating the request and obtaining authorization.<br>
        <b>VISSv2 server</b><br>
        The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using 
        <a href="#access-token-def">access tokens</a>.<br><br>
        The abstract protocol flow illustrated in the figure below describes the interaction between the four actors.<br>
        <figure id="fig-oauth2.0-flow">
          <img src="images/VISSv2-abstract-flow.jpg" alt="VISSv2 abstract protocol flow.">
          <figcaption> <span class="fig-title">The abstract protocol flow.</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        Besides the four actors directly involved in the abstract flow, there are two more actors.<br>
        <b>Resource owner</b><br>
        This is typically the driver of the vehicle, who may be asked for consent before access is granted.<br>
        <b>Ecosystem manager</b><br>
        The entity managing the access control ecosystem. It controls the Policy documents, 
        and manages the PKI ecosystem that the other actors may utilize.<br><br>
        The abstract protocol flow is implemented by two different flows, as will be described in the following chapters.<br>
        The process to obtain the credentials needed for <a href="#client-def">client</a> authentication is out-of-scope, 
        as well as the installation procedures for the <a href="#application-roles-def">applications</a>.

        <h2>Protocol Flows</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
        Two different flows are described. Which flow to use depends on the capabilities of the <a href="#client-def">client</a>.<br>
        If a <a href="#client-def">client</a> is able to run public key cryptographic primitives, 
        i.e. key pair generation and signatures, 
        and has access to some kind of trusted execution environment where private keys are protected from the regular execution environment, 
        then it can use the long term flow. <a href="#client-def">Clients</a> that do not have access to these capabilities, 
        or do not want to use them, must select the short term flow.<br>
        The advantage of using the long term flow is that the <a href="#client-def">client</a> can be trusted with longer expiry times of 
        <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>. 
        In the short term flow the <a href="#client-def">client</a> must due to a shorter expiry time contact the 
        <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant token server</a> more often to obtain a new 
        <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>.<br>
        A <a href="#client-def">client</a> selects the type of flow by either submitting a public key in the 
        <a href="#access-grant-request-def">access grant request</a>, or not. The latter leading to an short term flow.

          The access grant token server is in charge of producing <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a> to 
          <a href="#client-def">clients</a>.<br>
          Depending on the capabilities of the <a href="#client-def">client</a>, the specification supports two types of 
          <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>: Short term and long term 
          <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>.<br>
          Long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>, 
          are supported for those <a href="#client-def">clients</a> able to run public key cryptographic primitives, 
          i.e. key pair generation and signatures, 
          and is the recommended choice for <a href="#client-def">clients</a> with access to a trusted execution environment where 
          private keys are protected from the regular execution environment. 
          The specification also supports short term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a> that require 
          no extra capabilities in the client, 
          but due to its shorter expiry time it forces the client to contact the access grant token server more often before 
          <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a> requests for an <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a>.<br>
          The <a href="#client-def">client</a> request shall contain the following:
          <ul>
            <li>A <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a>.</li>
            <li>A set of <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proofs</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          In scenarios where both the client and the access grant token server are deployed in-vehicle the VIN parameter may be omitted, 
          in all other deployment scenarios it shall be present.
          <ul>
            <li>A VIN.</li>
          </ul>
          When a VIN is present in the request, the vehicle identity (vin) claim shall be present in the 
          <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>.<br>
          If the <a href="#client-def">client</a> needs a long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>, 
          then the request shall also contain:
          <ul>
            <li>A public key.</li>
          </ul> 
          The Vehicle identification number shall be for the vehicle that the <a href="#client-def">client</a> wants to access.<br>
          The <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a> contains all relevant information from the client, 
          i.e. for each of the three sub-actors that the <a href="#client-def">client</a> represents.<br>
          The <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proofs</a> are to be used for verifying the <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a>.<br>
          The public key shall be generated by the <a href="#client-def">client</a>, 
          and the associated private key must be under control of the <a href="#client-def">client</a>.<br><br>
          The main responsibilities of the access grant token server are:
          <ul>
            <li>To verify the <a href="#client-context-def"> client context</a>, and assess that their respective role request can be granted.</li>
            <li>To check that the vehicle represented by the VIN belong to this Ecosystem, and is accessible.</li>
            <li>To create an <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          The <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proofs</a> may include certificates from a Certificate Authority known by the 
          access grant token server. 
          For example, users might authenticate themselves using X.509 identity certificates and roles might be issued using attribute certificates. 
          In those cases, as part of the authentication protocol, 
          the access grant token server shall also validate the certificates signatures.<br>
          The access grant token server may contact the <a href="#ecosystem-manager-def">ecosystem manager</a> for checking the VIN.<br>
          The <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> generation is defined in the corresponding chapter.

        The <a href="#client-def">client</a> request shall contain at least these two parameters below.
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#access-grant-token-def">Access grant token</a>.</li>
            <li><a>Purpose</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        For long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>, i.e. those including a public key, the 
        <a href="#client-def">client</a> must also include a <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proof of possession</a>, 
        for the corresponding private key, in the request.<br>
        The <a>purpose</a> must be supported by the <a href="#ecosystem-manager-def">ecosystem manager</a>, and thus be on the 
        <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a>. 
        The <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a> associates a set of accessible signals to the <a>purpose</a>, 
        thus realizing the principle of least privilege.<br>
        The main responsibilities of the access token server are:
          <ul>
            <li>To validate the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>.</li>
            <li>To validate that the <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a> provides permission for the requested <a>purpose</a>.</li>
            <li>To create an <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        The validation of the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> consists of at least the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Signature validation.</li>
            <li>Expiry time check.</li>
          </ul>
        Additionally, for long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>, the access token server needs to verify the 
        <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proof of possession</a> using the public key contained in the token.<br>
        The <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> signature validation is done with the 
        <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant token server</a> public key. 
        <br>
        To allow for some time synchronization inaccuracy and minor network latency, 
        expiry times should be set to include potential modest margin of error, possibly as long as tens of seconds.<br>
        If a vehicle identity claim (vin) is present in the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>, 
        the vehicle identity (vin) claim SHALL be included in the access token.<br>
        If the <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a> as declared in the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> 
        does not match in the set of allowed roles for the requested <a>purpose</a> in the <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a>, 
        then the <a href="#client-def">client</a> request for an <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> must be denied.<br>

        <h2>Access Control Server</h2>
        <p>
        The VISSv2 server MUST support validation of <a href="#access-token-def">access tokens</a>. 
        The functionality needed for this is decribed in this chapter.
        This includes validation of at least the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Token signature.</li>
            <li>Token expiry time.</li>
          </ul>
          If a vehicle identity claim (vin) is present in the token, then it MUST be validated to match the identity of this vehicle.<br>
          If any of the mentioned validations fail, the server MUST reject the access request.<br>
          Token signature validation may be delegated to the <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a>, 
          if a secure communication link can be established.
          If not delegated, then a preprovisioned common secret may be shared with the <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a>, 
          or other PKI based solutions may be used.<br>
          The VISSv2 server SHALL have access to a secure system time, that cannot be modified by actors without system acknowledged credentials. 
          Time validation may allow for a time synchronization inaccuracy in the range of tens of seconds.<br>
          After a successful token validation, the server MUST check that the scope of the token is compatible with the request.
          If the scope claim of the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> contains a <a>purpose</a> short-name, successful validation requires that all the nodes addressed by the path in the request MUST 
          be matched by the paths associated with the <a>purpose</a> in the <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a> .<br>
          If the scope claim of the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> contains a explicit list of signals, successful validation requires that all the nodes addressed by the path in the request MUST 
          be matched by the one of the signals included in the token.<br>
          Validation of the <a href="#device-roles-def">device</a> and <a href="#application-roles-def">app </a>roles may involve MAC address checks, 
          or message round-trip measurements.<br>
          The access permission validation MUST have the outcome shown in the table below, 
          when comparing the type of the <a href="#client-def">client</a> request with the access control mode either in the 
          <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a> or the explicit signals that are associated to the scope claim in the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a>.
          If the <a href="#client-def">client</a> request contains several signals, and one fails the validation, 
          then the entire request MUST be rejected.<br><br>

          The <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> need to be refreshed periodically, which is controlled by the expiry time. 
          If the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> that the <a href="#client-def">client</a> used to obtain the now expired 
          <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> is not expired, 
          then the <a href="#client-def">client</a> can revisit the <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a> with this 
          <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> to obtain a new <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a>.<br>
          If the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> is expired, then the <a href="#client-def">client</a> must obtain a new

          The server SHOULD support caching of a limited number of <a href="#access-token-def">access tokens</a>. 
          The <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> MUST be included in the cache after a first successful request and 
          MUST be removed once they expire. 
          The client can decide to include only the jti claim in following requests in order to save bandwith. 
          At any point the server might decide to remove any token from the cache. In this case the client will get a "401, 
          missing_token" error and will be forced to send the whole <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> again.
          For <a href="#client-def">client</a> requests that are not granted due to access control, 
          the VISSv2 server MUST return one of the error codes shown in the table below.<br>

          <h2>Proof of Possession</h2>
          <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>

          <p>
            Long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a> need to be accompanied by a Proof of Possession (PoP) 
            for the private key corresponding to the public key included in the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>. 
            This requirement enables a longer validity for this kind of tokens, ranging from a few days to a even a year.
            By adding the PoP, we prevent an eavesdropper to reuse an <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> request, 
            impersonating the client. Without a PoP, the longer the validity of an <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>, 
            the higher the risk an attacker could intercept and reuse it.
            PoP for JWT are defined in [[RFC7800]], but in essence, 
            a PoP enables the requester to proof to the server that it has access to a private key, without disclosing it. 
            Traditionally that would require the server to create a random challenge, or nonce, and ask the client to sign it with its private key. 
            Along with the public key, 
            the server would be able to verify the PoP.
            This scheme would require an extra step in the protocols, where the client ask for the nonce.
          </p><p>
            In order to avoid this extra step, the client can generate the nonce itself. The server would need to check that nonces are not reused. 
            Although logging previous nonces at the server side would work for small environments, 
            we propose the use of an incremental nonce in the form of a timestamp. 
            One of the drawbacks of this proposal is that the server has no means to check whether the PoP has been precomputed or not. 
            However, this is irrelevant from the eavesdropper point of view.
          </p><p>
            In case freshness of the PoP was a critical requirement, we could use a public source of randomness to obtain the nonce, 
            e.g. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/leagueofentropy/">Leage of Entropy</a> or 
            <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/interoperable-randomness-beacons">Interoperable Randomness Beacons</a>. 
            That would provide the server a mean to check freshness of the PoP but on the other hand,

        <h2>Client Context</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
        The <a href="#client-def">client</a> actor is characterized by three subactors:
          <ul>
            <li>The <a href="#user-roles-def">user</a> of the application.</li>
            <li>The <a href="#application-roles-def">application</a>.</li>
            <li>The <a href="#device-roles-def">device</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          Each of these subactors is in turn characterized by a role, 
          building on the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model</a>. 
          The set of these three roles is called the Client context.<br>
          VISSv2 specifies a rudimentary list of roles for each subactor, it is expected that these lists are augmented by the 
          <a href="#ecosystem-manager-def">ecosystem manager</a>, hopefully in a cooperative effort.<br>
          Using an RBAC model provides the following main purposes in the VISSv2 access control model:
          <ul>
            <li>Input to the <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant token server</a> in the 
            <a href="#client-def">client</a> authentication process.</li>
            <li>Input to the <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a> in the <a>purpose</a> validation.</li>
          </ul>
        The <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant token server</a> must in the authentication process of the client 
        possibly separately authenticate each of the three subactors. 
        For the <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant token server</a> to decide on which authentication method to use per subactor 
        can be quite complex, but may be somewhat eased by the <a href="#client-def">client</a> request for roles for each subactor.<br>
        Following the principle of least priviledge, a <a href="#client-def">client</a> should not have access to more vehicle signals than necessary. 
        This is achieved by the <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a>, that assigns only the for the 
        <a>purpose</a> relevant signals to the <a href="#client-def">client</a>.

        <h2>Access Control Selection</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
        This chapter describes a complementary functionality to the access control model, the ability to apply it selectively to parts of the tree. 
        It can be used in cases where not all nodes of the tree are believed to require access control, 
        or where write-only validation is sufficient instead of read-write validation for certain nodes.<br>
        This functionality requires that the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> specifies whether the access permission granted to the 
        <a href="#client-def">client</a> to a signal is read-only, or read-write.
        It also requires that the metadata for the node in the VSS tree contains data specifying whether 
        the access control verification should be carried out only for write request, or for both read and write requests.<br>
        The former requirement is realized as described in earlier chapters by that the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> 
        scope claim links to a <a>purpose</a> where the signals and their respective access permission are found.<br>
        The latter requirement is realized by adding to nodes in the VSS tree the key-value pair "validate":'access-control-mode', 
        where 'access-control-mode' is either the string "write-only", or "read-write".<br>
        <figure id="fig-access-control-selection">
          <img src="images/access-control-selection.jpg" alt="Access control selection tagging.">
          <figcaption> <span class="fig-title">Access control selection tagging.</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        The figure above shows an example where both read and write requests to the three leftmost leaf nodes will be access controlled, 
        while the two rightmost leaf nodes only will be access controlled for write requests. 
        An inheritance rule leads to that any nodes below a tagged node are assigned the same access control, if they are untagged.<br>
        This metadata is not likely to be applied to the standardised VSS tree, 
        as different implementers of this standard may have different views on which nodes to apply it to. 
        Instead it is anticipated that it is applied at a "deployment" stage, possibly using the VSS layering concept.<br>
        The inheritance model, which says that if access-control-mode data is added to a node, 
        then all nodes in the subtree for which this node is the root inherits the setting, 
        unless there is access-control-mode data added to any node in this subtree, 
        makes possible a reduction of the number of nodes this metadata have to be added to.<br>
        This allows for example an entire VSS tree to be assigned an access-control-mode by merely applying it in the root of the tree.<br>
        The figure below shows an overview of the access control selection model, 
        and a table showing the required access control tagging of a node for the VISSv2 server to grant the requested access. 
        <figure id="fig-access-control-selection-model">

          <figcaption> <span class="fig-title">Access control selection model.</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        If the VSS tree used by a VISSv2 server contains access control selection tags, 
        then the server MUST support their usage as described in this chapter.<br>
        If it is not used, then a server may implement access control for the entire tree.<br>
