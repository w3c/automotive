# W3C Automotive Working Group

This was the repository for the specifications created by the [Automotive Working Group](http://www.w3.org/auto/wg/).

The group closed in November of 2023 and the work is continuing with [COVESA](https://covesa.global) with whom W3C has had a long standing collaboration.

The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS) development will be at: 
[https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle-information-service-specification](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle-information-service-specification) and the open source reference implementation at [https://github.com/COVESA/vissr](https://github.com/COVESA/vissr)

> The mission of the W3C Automotive Working Group was to develop Open Web Platform specifications for HTML5/JavaScript application developers enabling Web connectivity through in-vehicle infotainment systems and vehicle data access protocols. The API is agnostic with regard to the connection used.
