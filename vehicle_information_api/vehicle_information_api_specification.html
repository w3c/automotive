    <!-- Abstract -->
    <section id="abstract">
  <p>This specification defines a high level API for accessing to vehicle signals and data attributes.</p>
  <p>The purpose of the specification is to promote a client implementation with a standard API that enables application development in a consistent manner across participating automotive manufacturers.</p>

    <section id="introduction" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The following documents the specification required for a high level API designed to interface with vehicle signals. This specification is responsible for the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connection lifecycle (open, reconnect, failover, closure)</li>
        <li>Authorization token transmission (not retrieval)</li>
        <li>Request lifecycle</li>
        <li>Subscription lifecycle</li>
        <li>VSS tree discovery and traversal</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In general, the client should strive for the following goals:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Provide a level abstraction exposing all functionality of the underlying server.</li>
        <li>Provide an API that would be familiar to JavaScript developers including following best-practices when dealing with asynchronous operations.</li>
        <li>Exhibit good behavior with regard to socket allocation.</li>
        <li>Provide clear feedback on errors, especially those related to security credentials.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      This API specification is designed assuming to communicate with in-vehicle data servers which provide vehicle signals and data attributes.
      The VIS server defined in VISS specification is a typical example of the server, however servers of other types which have appropriate functions should also be applicable.

    <section id="terminology">
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p> The term 'VISS' is used to refer to the 'Vehicle Information Service Specification' (see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/automotive/vehicle_data/vehicle_information_service.html">here</a>) which is in the process of developed in W3C Automotive Working Group along with this specification.
      The term 'VIS Server' is used to refer to a server which conforms to the 'VISS' specification.
      </p>
      <p> The term 'VIAS' is used to refer to the 'Vehicle Information API Specification' which is this document.</p>
      <p> The term 'VSS' is used to refer to the 'Vehicle Signal Specification' (see <a href="https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification/">here</a>) which is defined in Genivi alliance activity.
      </p>

      <p>The term 'WebSocket' when used in this document, is as defined in the W3C WebSocket API (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-websockets-20110929">here</a>) and the WebSocket Protocol (see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC6455</a>).</p>

      <!-- Connection -->
    <section id="connection">
      <h2>Connection</h2>
      <p>
      This specification assumes a connection to a server provides vehicle signals in underlying layer.<br>
      The connections could be categorized to two kinds those are 'connection-oriented' and 'connectionless'.</p>
      <p>In case of 'connection-oriented' communications (e.g. WebSocket), a connection should be managed and kept open while client and server communicate.
      An application can manage the connection status with APIs defined in this specification such as 'connect', 'disconnect' methods and 'onConnect', 'onDisconnect' handlers.<br>
      In case of 'connectionless' communication (e.g. HTTP(S)), there is no demand to maintain a connection to be kept open. In that case, connection management with 'connect', 'disconnect' methods are not necessary.</p>
      <p>From this reason, 'connect', 'disconnect' methods and 'onConnect', 'onDisconnect' handlers are defined as optional and they have to be implemented only when required.<br>
      Examples in this document are written assuming 'connection-oriented' type for underlying communication.<br>
      (Strictly speaking, HTTP(S) is not a 'connectionless' communication in the real meaning since it works over TCP.
      However in case of HTTP(S), application layer does not have to be aware of connection status and from this view point, describe it as 'connectionless' communication in this context.)
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Security and privacy -->
    <section id="security">
      <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <p>
      This specification defines an interface to the underling server and does not expose any platform capabilities by itself.
      The underling server is responsible for managing privileges of each client connection
       and the VIAS implementation is responsible for passing requests and responses securely between clients and the server.
      </p>
      <p>
      One of possible implementation methods of VIAS would be as a form of JavaScript library.<br>
      In that case, as a necessary security consideration, the JavaScript library SHOULD be provided from a trusted origin.
      Otherwise a malicious library could be loaded instead and any data goes through the library could be eavesdropped or tampered.
      Authorization tokens may goes through the library as well and if token leaking happens, security of the underlying server could be damaged.
      The underlying server itself should be considered as one of trusted origins from the VIAS JavaScript library implementation.

      <h2><code>VISClient</code> Interface</h2>

      <pre class="idl">
      [Constructor(optional VISClientOptions options)]
      interface VISClient
      {
        readonly attribute DOMString? host;
        readonly attribute DOMString? protocol;
        readonly attribute unsigned short? port;

        void getVSS(GetVSSCallback callback);
        void get(DOMString path, GetCallback callback);
        void set(DOMString path, any value , SetCallback callback);
        void subscribe(DOMString path, SubscribeCallback callback, optional SubscribeFilters filters);
        void unsubscribe(VISSubscription subscription, UnsubscribeCallback callback);
        void? disconnect();
      };

      interface VISClientOptions
      {
        attribute DOMString? host;
        attribute DOMString? protocol;
        attribute unsigned short? port;
      };

      interface VISValue
      {
        attribute any value;
        attribute DOMTimeStamp timeStamp;

        attribute DOMString? reason;
        attribute DOMString? message;
        attribute DOMTimeStamp timeStamp;
      };
      </pre>

      <h3>Constructor</h3>
      <p>The <code>VISClient</code> constructor, when invoked, must return a new VISClient object.<br>
      This constructor takes VISClientOptions object as a parameter. The parameter is optional and the necessity depends on underlying communication type.
      </p>

      <pre class="example">
      const client = new VISClient({ /* VISClientOptions object */ });
      </pre>

      <h3>VISClientOptions Interface</h3>
      <p>
      VISClientOptions interface is designed assuming a connection to a vehicle signal server which is specifiable by protocol, host and port. In case the underlying connection requires other parameters, implementer can add parameters according to the requirement.<br>
      These values are set at initialization only and cannot be changed after a connection has established.</p>

          protocol for the connection to a vehicle signal server. All the communications between the client and server MUST be appropriately encrypted. Therefore, in case of WebSocket, <code>'wss'</code> is required and in case of http, <code>'https'</code> is required. Non encrypted communication is not supported.</td>

      </table>

      <h3>Methods</h3>
      <p>Once created, a client provides several functions for interacting with the server.</p>

      <p>Many of the functions listed below require a `path` string to be passed that identifies the portion of the VSS that is being referenced. See VSS below for how to generate this string based on traversing the VSS tree.</p>
